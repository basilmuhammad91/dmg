					<description><![CDATA[The redevelopment of the Les Halles neighbourhood in the heart of Paris is nearing completion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The vast project, led by <a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction France</a>, will give the iconic neighbourhood a new look. More than 30 years after it opened, the site needed to be restructured and upgraded to keep pace with increasing numbers of visitors, renew the aging structures and adapt to changes in the applicable safety regulations.</p>



<h4>Creation of the Canopy</h4>



<p></p>



<p>The Canopy, symbolising this transformation, is a huge 25,000 sq. metre translucent skylight that spreads its protective shade over this enormous urban beehive. Every day, in addition to thousands of tourists and neighbourhood residents, the Les Halles underground station, Europe’s largest, serves as a transit point for 750,000 people and the shopping centre, the city’s largest, welcomes 150,000 customers.</p>



<p>The construction teams achieved a technical and logistical feat by carrying out this large urban renewal project over a period of  three years without disruption for people in the area or the many businesses operating there.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Both a stadium and a concert hall: XXL indoor format.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>A multi-purpose arena</h4>



<p></p>



<p>At the western tip of the La Défense business district near Paris, the structure built for the Racing Arena company boasts a surface area of about 115,000 sq. metres and can be configured as either a rugby stadium (30,681 spectators) or a concert hall (up to 40,000 spectators) as required. A joint venture led by GTM Bâtiment with architect Christian de Portzamparc is building the complex €282 million project under a design-build contract. Several other <a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction France</a> subsidiaries – Petit, Chantiers Modernes Construction and TPI – are also involved. &nbsp;</p>



<h4>Sports and concerts</h4>



<p></p>



<p>The modern, user-friendly arena was designed as a very large concert hall – the largest indoor facility of its kind in Europe – that can also host about 20 rugby matches per year, as stipulated by the project’s initiator, Jacky Lorenzetti, Chairman of Ovalto and President of Racing 92, who is an enthusiastic rugby fan. The multi-purpose design will ensure a steady independent, long-term income stream, further consolidated by the inclusion of an office building to enhance the overall return on investment for the customer. The U Arena is one of the sites selected to support Paris’s bid to host the 2024 Olympics, in which it would be used for the gymnastics and weightlifting events.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paris-la-defense-arena_vinci_construction-3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2444" width="721" height="480" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paris-la-defense-arena_vinci_construction-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paris-la-defense-arena_vinci_construction-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paris-la-defense-arena_vinci_construction-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/paris-la-defense-arena_vinci_construction-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px" /><figcaption>Paris La Défense Arena, interior view – © A. Da Silva/Graphix-images</figcaption></figure>



<h4>Technical challenges</h4>



<p></p>



<p>Several technical challenges had to be overcome in the course of the project. Its location in the heart of an office and residential neighbourhood and the inclusion in the same programme of an office building adjacent to the arena called for <strong>very effective acoustic insulation</strong>. To cope with the <strong>ground below the buildings</strong>, which is criss-crossed with utility lines, <a href="https://www.soletanche-bachy.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soletanche Bachy</a>, in charge of deep foundations, achieved feats of technical ingenuity. The lack of space also entailed the installation of <strong>six construction cranes within the footprint of the structure</strong>, with major impact on the project’s phasing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ 25,000 cu. metres of immersed concrete placed in a single pour, setting a world record.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The memorial museum in Gdansk, on the banks of the Motlawa River, was built by a joint venture comprising VINCI Construction International Network subsidiary Warbud, Hochtief Polska and Hochtief Solutions AG. The building, in which 80% of the &nbsp;floor area is underground, has a distinctive 40 metre high tilted tower symbolising the ruins left by the conflict.</p>



<p>Prior to construction, Soletanche Bachy subsidiary Soletanche Polska carried out excavations to a depth of 18 metres and built the raft foundations using the immersed concrete method, which set a world record in the category. The seven-storey museum with six underground levels is located immediately adjacent to the historic city centre and the Vistula estuary. Its 58,000 sq. metre floor area contains exhibition rooms as well as conference rooms, a cinema, a library and archives.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Reinventing a university with the help of a philosopher.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To reinvent the Toulouse &#8211; Jean Jaurès University, the teams set up a dialogue with the stakeholders and asked philosopher Michel Serres to take part in the discussion. The 130,000 sq. metre campus was entirely rebuilt to retain the original concept based on modular space, combine it with ideas regarding the environmental performance of the buildings and accommodate 26,000 students.</p>



<p>The lecture halls and classrooms were built without interior posts to enable them to be re-arranged without the need for structural changes.</p>



<p>Handed over at the end of 2016, the project ultimately involved construction of 58,000 sq. metres of flooring over more than 50% of the total surface area of the site (sports facilities, lecture halls, 7,000 sq. metre canopy, 200 student housing units, 120 housing units for young workers and 1,100 parking spaces), and renovation of a number of existing buildings.</p>



<p>The project substantially improves campus living and working conditions, provides new services and enhances the university’s international reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the glass floor on the first level of the Eiffel Tower, visitors can stroll above the void and then explore two new pavilions and two pagodas with oblique facades. It was a challenge to build the first level, which stands 75 metres off the ground, while ensuring visitor safety and keeping the site open to the public. It was also a challenge to supply the worksite, striking a constant balance between loads of deconstructed materials to be removed and new construction materials to be brought in.</p>



<h4>Solar, wind and rainwater</h4>



<p></p>



<p>Four solar panels with a combined surface area of 10 sq. metres cover nearly 50% of the hot water needs of the Ferrié and Eiffel pavilions and a rainwater tank was placed below the Ferrié pavilion to supply the lavatories. Wind turbines were also installed on the technical roofs of the second-level Michelin-starred restaurant. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new Nice stadium boasts unprecedented environmental performance.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Nice stadium, now named the Allianz Riviera, was the first sports arena built in France to host the Euro UEFA 2016 football championship. It uses a combination of innovative ideas (public private partnership, naming agreements, cultural and corporate events, etc.) applied to other recent projects and environmental innovations that make it one of the world’s leading “ecostadiums”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The 36,000-seat Allianz Riviera with its outstanding environmental features was built in just under two years. Its innovative equipment includes natural ventilation and geothermal cooling systems, a photovoltaic solar power plant and a rainwater recovery system.</p>



<p>The composite wood and steel roof offsets the equivalent CO2 emissions of one year of stadium operation.</p>



<p>It took 14 versions to finalise the geometry of the wooden grid made up of solid beams, which halved the number of heavy and costly metal assembly nodes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new Matmut Atlantique stadium in Bordeaux was inaugurated on 18 May 2015.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Built under a public&nbsp; private partnership, the Bordeaux stadium is the largest arena in western France, with 42,000 seats in sports configuration and up to 45,000 seats in concert configuration. It is France’s first connected stadium and was built within a very short time frame between November 2012 and April 2015.</p>



<h4>A stadium with a spectacular design</h4>



<p></p>



<p>The stadium, designed by the Herzog &amp; De Meuron architectural firm (which also designed the Olympic stadium in Beijing and the Allianz Arena in Munich), has a striking rectangular roof supported by a forest of slender posts. Inside, the seats are protected from the elements and form a bowl set into the ground.</p>



<p>Once the initial concrete was poured, work on the metal framing began very early in the project and was carried out at the same time as the structural works. This called for rigorous phasing and teamwork among the participants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the Cité du Vin de Bordeaux, the world-famous wine region now has a high-profile place dedicated to the exploration of the culture going back thousands of years. Built to HQE® (high environmental quality) standards by VINCI Construction France subsidiaries GTM Bâtiment Aquitaine and Arbonis, the building’s unusual geometry symbolises the circular movement of wine in a glass during a traditional tasting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A torus – a round, circular cross-section moulding – carries the visitor around a 55-metre tower. These concrete, wood (frame), glass and aluminium (cladding) curves required the use of 3D BIM from the competitive dialogue phase onwards.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ The large hospital complex on the outskirts of Noumea is the largest public infrastructure project ever built in New Caledonia.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>All Territorial Hospital Centre departments were brought together at a single site.</p>



<p>The teams from the joint venture led by VINCI subsidiaries VINCI Construction and VINCI Energies delivered the Koutio Médipôle, the new hospital complex in Noumea, in early 2016. The project, unprecedented in New Caledonia and in the Pacific area, brings together at the same site all the departments of the Territorial Hospital Centre (CHT), which were previously spread out over four different locations.</p>



<p>The €280 million works contract awarded to VINCI was completed in the short space of four years. The 82,000 sq. metre hospital complex has 12 operating theatres and a total of 450 rooms and 650 beds.</p>



<p>The new Médipôle complex will provide more than half of the territory’s healthcare services and its special structural design will enable it to expand to keep pace with the territory’s future healthcare needs. The project is New Caledonia’s first facility to receive the High Environmental Quality certification.</p>



<h5>An ambitious timetable and efficient organisation</h5>



<p></p>



<p>The joint venture employed the full range of its expertise to cope with the technical and logistical challenges and coordinate the teams from Metropolitan France and New Caledonia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ An earthquake-resistant technical facility for the Fort de France hospital]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction handed over a new 40,000 sq. metre technical facility at the La Meynard teaching hospital in Fort de France, which notably brings together 13 operating theatres, an emergency and radiology department, a critical care unit and a lab. One of the major challenges was to ensure that the hospital, which is located in a seismically very active area, can continue to function following an earthquake.</p>



<p>To earthquake-proof the building, the superstructure was placed on a network of 288 elastomer dampers that separate it from its foundations. In addition, 36 horizontal dampers were installed perpendicular to the facades. Freyssinet developed these advanced techniques. In the event of an earthquake, the vibrations propagated through the ground will be filtered and thus hardly, if at all, transmitted to the building, which can continue to operate.</p>



<p>Sogea Martinique succeeded in meeting the further challenge of carrying out the work next to the existing facility while ensuring access to the emergency room and avoiding disruption of the operation of the adjacent departments.&nbsp;</p>
