					<description><![CDATA[Led by the teams of VINCI Construction Terrassement in Bourgneuf in conjunction with Equo Vivo, the hydromorphological restoration of the Glandon river was designed to diversify its flows, create new habitats, improve water quality and restore biodiversity in this tributary of the Isère.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Glandon river, which flows through the Savoie province of Maurienne before flowing into the Isère, had previously suffered a series of ecological problems following its artificial modification. The hydromorphological restoration project to restore the watercourse to its former route and improve its hydraulic functioning will eventually (over the next 3 to 5 years) restore&nbsp;<strong>its biological communities of animal and plant life to their proper balance&nbsp;</strong>by making more habitats available, for example. The erosion of minor beds has been reversed using&nbsp;<strong>plant engineering&nbsp;</strong>techniques.</p>



<p>One of the primary goals of the project was to restore aquatic species to their natural habitat so that they can move freely through the watercourse, feed and breed. For example, large blocks of quarried stone have been placed in the watercourse and arranged to accelerate or decelerate water flows. In this way, they create deeper pools where trout and char can rest, as well as faster running and more extensive areas where they can feed. Free blocks create an easily accessible ramp between the Gardon and the Isère.</p>

<h4>A wider riverbed to accommodate a more diverse range of plants</h4>



<p>The hydromorphological restoration of the Glandon river has also enabled the creation of a new bed for one section of the river. Thanks to a series of particularly dry autumn months, the teams of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.equo-vivo.com/">Equo Vivo</a>&nbsp;were able to widen the riverbed from 5-7 metres to 10-20 metres over a short period of time. This wider bed will allow the gradual development of a more diverse range of plants. Returning water to the river clearly reveals its new route, complemented by new plantings of native species, such as willow.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Deconstruction of a former factory to clean up the building prior to demolition.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Working for Honeywell, Neom, a subsidiary of VINCI Construction France specialising in deconstruction and asbestos removal, completed the deconstruction of the former automotive brake pad manufacturing site in the Calvados region in the summer of 2016. The works covered asbestos dust removal, asbestos removal, cleaning and demolition of the former factory. The project called for tight coordination between the asbestos removal and deconstruction works, innovative methods (3D modelling of the areas to be treated) and precise phasing. When the project was completed, no buildings were left at the site. Since then another provider has begun work to demolish the slab and remediate the soil. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The energy from waste plant is being upgraded to handle large volumes of waste and generate electricity and heat.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After 30 years in operation, one of the Charleroi energy from waste plant’s two incineration lines had reached the end of its service life. A new line therefore needed to be designed and built to replace it. The new line will treat 46,500 tonnes of household waste and 8,500 tonnes of industrial waste annually. The process will generate electricity and heating.</p>



<p>The notification to proceed was issued on 20 December 2016. The work, set to take 37 months to complete, and in which VINCI Environnement will participate, will modernise the site with a new-generation stepped grid for optimum combustion, a three-pass vertical boiler to save energy in producing reliable steam (23.65 tonnes/ hour at 41.5 bar) and an innovative BICAR dry flue gas treatment unit.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[VINCI companies pooled their expertise and operated in synergy to build the modern facility, which uses state-of-the-art waste recovery technologies. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI is part of the IP13 joint venture (led by Suez Environnement subsidiary Sita) responsible for the major part of the design-build contract for the Ivry-Paris XIII waste recovery centre currently under construction. The comprehensive contract was signed in March 2015. The project, which has a value of €513 million for all VINCI business lines, will take just over 12 years to complete.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Cornwall Energy Recovery Centre puts a stop to landfilling and generates energy for households and industries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Environnement worked with VINCI Construction UK to complete construction of the Cornwall Energy Recovery Centre (CERC) household waste treatment facility.</p>



<p>The energy recovery centre was commissioned following 1.5 million hours worked without accident.</p>



<p>Designed to recover energy from household waste generated in the county of Cornwall and thereby reduce landfilling of non-recyclable waste, the unit will handle up to 240,000 tonnes of non-recyclable residual waste per year using innovative and environmentally proven processes. The facility will also generate 184,000 MWh of electricity annually, enough to supply 21,000 households, and deliver heat to nearby industrial plants.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The coast stretching from Casablanca to Mohammedia is now cleaner, thanks to a wastewater interception system.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>King Mohammed VI inaugurated the eastern coastal pollution control system in Greater Casablanca, built by Sogea-Satom. The system intercepts wastewater discharged between the port of Casablanca and the city of Mohammedia and channels it to the pretreatment plant at Sidi Bernoussi, which was also built by Sogea-Satom. The project involved 230,000 cu. metres of earthworks to a depth of 17 metres below sea level, 1,400 tonnes of reinforcement steel, 15,000 cu. metres of reinforced concrete and 4,700 sq. metres of roofing. It will better protect the population in the eastern part of Casablanca from the risk of pollution due to discharge of wastewater, notably from industry, into the sea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>After working on the extension of the Verdun Memorial, VINCI Construction Terrassement’s specialised subsidiary Navarra TS is carrying out a major pyrotechnical cleanup project in a number of areas in the Douaumont and Vaux forts and the Douaumont ossuary.</p>



<p>The operations, which require particular care, have made it possible to find and secure large amounts of ordnance and are set for completion at the end of 2017.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Seine-Aval treatment plant in the Yvelines department, which treats wastewater from the Greater Paris area (population 6 million), is Europe’s largest.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction France and Dodin Campenon Bernard are working on the downstream Seine wastewater treatment plant to help keep pace with population growth in the western part of the Paris area, drastically reduce the amount of pollution discharged to the Seine and better control noise and odour.</p>



<p>The Seine-Aval plant is now undergoing a comprehensive renovation. The first phase, commissioned in February 2016, covered the “pre-treatment” facilities designed to sieve, de-sand and de-oil wastewater. The plant continued to operate during the works. The second phase consists in upgrading wastewater biological treatment through biofiltration and membrane ultrafiltration.</p>
