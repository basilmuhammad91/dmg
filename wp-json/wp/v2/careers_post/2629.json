To round out our wastewater solutions and services, we can now work in partnership with Bessac, a subsidiary of Soletanche Bachy, to get the benefit of its know-how in tunnel and microtunnel construction, and we can also count on the support of HDI, an Entrepose subsidiary specialising in horizontal directional drilling. In our second speciality \u2013 foundations and geotechnical works \u2013 the synergies with Soletanche Freyssinet are obvious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to do our best to make the most of them, especially on the Auckland City Rail Link project, a 3.5 km underground line through the Auckland city centre. A joint venture was set up between Soletanche Bachy and the Downer Group in New Zealand to handle the first phase of the contract, which involves enabling works including construction of twin rail tunnels underneath the historic Chief Post Office building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are also in the ECI phase of a project for New Zealand\u2019s deepest building basement (five levels) which would use the innovative XS2 Hydrofraise\u00ae, a first in the region.
