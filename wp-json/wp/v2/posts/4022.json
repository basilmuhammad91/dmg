We came to an obvious conclusion when examining our building sites: demolition and refurbishment work generates enough rubble to fill a good number of skips. Sanitary appliances, tiles, windows, doors, paint, glue&#8230; a good third of what we put into the dumpster is still in good condition. Unfortunately, everything would go to the waste facility and end up in a landfill. We were really not happy with this. We did not want to sit idly by and decided to do something to change the situation. I got in touch with several people, including members of Synergie P\u00e9i, a non-profit organisation on Reunion Island which is working with regional authorities and businesses as part of an environmental sustainability initiative that promotes the recycling and reclaiming of residual materials. We got our heads together to work on viable solutions. Working with other businesses, we came up with the idea of a \u201cbuilding materials library\u201d, i.e. a place where we could store the materials that still have life in them and sell them at bargain prices. So far though, we have not found a suitable place, nor the funds to cover the rental fee. Since we really wanted this project to take off, we came up with the idea of starting a yard sale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-lavabo-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4023\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-lavabo-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-lavabo-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-lavabo-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-lavabo-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So how did the yard sale work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Faouzi Ben-Abdallah: <\/strong>We decided on a temporary event, which settled the question of premises. It was a great success. We organised the first yard sale in November 2019 at the port, during the European Week for Waste Reduction. Everything was bought up in the space of three days! On our side, the proceeds from the sale were enough to cover all the costs of organising the event. We offered both used and unused materials from our worksites, which otherwise would have been destroyed and\/or sent to a landfill. By selling them to private individuals and companies at bargain prices, we put them back in the loop. It is a real virtuous cycle as regards the materials, and a real service to buyers who can make significant savings. In 2020, we even accelerated the pace and started organising these yard sales on a monthly basis. To give you an idea of the volumes involved, approximately 7 tonnes of residual materials were sold at the 4 yard sales that took place between August and November, corresponding to more than 150 different assorted items, such as toilets, bathtubs, washbasins, lighting fixtures, doors, sinks, taps, kitchen countertops&#8230; Because of the current health protocols, we organised a time-slot reservation system in order to avoid crowds forming. And it worked very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-S2r-2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4015\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-S2r-2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-S2r-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-S2r-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/brocante-S2r-2.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the next steps?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Faouzi Ben-Abdallah: <\/strong>At the end of December 2020, we responded to the Call for Expressions of Interest issued by the Innovation Plan for the French Overseas Territories, which is part of the Investment Plan led by the General Secretariat for Investment. We set up this project with a number of other partners, including the University of Reunion Island, several research laboratories and the island\u2019s main subsidised housing company. Entitled REHABILIS, the project aims to provide a sustainable solution to the problem of construction waste (fittings, furniture, materials, etc.) by turning this waste into a source of social and economic wealth. Our proposal focuses on three areas. Firstly, the circular economy: our goal is to organise the sector to make it easier to recover and recondition residual materials before putting them back into the loop by reselling them to private individuals or businesses. That is the idea behind the \u201cmaterials library\u201d for which we want to find a permanent location. This should lead to new jobs, as we will likely hire new employees as part of our social integration approach. The second area consists in converting waste into raw materials that can be reused on our worksites. An example is the residual glass wool from our worksites, which can be turned into a bio-composite thermal insulation material when combined with bio-sourced coconut fibres. Finally, the third area of focus is pilot projects. The idea is to identify construction projects on the island, to get in touch with the design team, and share with them the list of all available residual materials on our projects, such as sanitary appliances or windows. They would then be able to incorporate these low-cost materials into their designs. The \u201cwaste\u201d that we produce would therefore be given a life extension. For the time being, we are waiting to find out if our project will be selected. But we are optimistic, because it offers relevant strategies that can have a true impact on the economy, on employment and on the environment, in a very short time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>S2R, a VINCI Construction subsidiary on Reunion Island, is carrying out building decommissioning and refurbishment projects.
