What makes this a complex project?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Abdramane Kone: It is a <strong>new and complex project that departs from our usual jobs,<\/strong> but we were able to carry it out with a young team and 95% of locally recruited staff. The Ouagadougou bus station <strong>truly showcases Sogea-Satom&#8217;s expertise<\/strong>; through this project, we were able to demonstrate our skills in roadworks, building works and steel construction. We first built a <strong>temporary station <\/strong>to allow road hauliers to continue working. We then went on to build the station that you see today. We also built <strong>a boarding and loading platform and twenty or so buildings (including a two-storey building that can accommodate two additional storeys, as well as shops and restaurants), with roadworks around the station.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>What are the benefits of the new bus station?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A.K: The station is expected to become an economic hub for Ouagadougou and its surrounding area. Also, much care has been put into its design, which incorporates solutions that solve the sanitation and drainage issues that had been plaguing local residents for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>How has the environmental impact of the project been taken into account?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A.K: We have installed special facilities. For example, on the boarding and loading platform, we installed renewable energy equipment comprising an <strong>integrated solar roof that generates 130 kW when running at peak<\/strong>. The system can power the entire station all day long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4>What was the highlight of this journey?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A.K: There were <strong>several significant moments all along this journey, <\/strong>but if I had to single out only one, it would be the day when the people living near the station and the future occupants came as a delegation to thank us for having improved their living environment and solved the problems they had been experiencing for several years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A sense of accomplishment, of a job well done: that\u2019s what I felt when those residents came to thank us. It is also one of the reasons why I chose this profession: to do my bit and contribute to building a better future wherever we have projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-style-default\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"819\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-1024x819.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3884\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-1024x819.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-300x240.png 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-768x614.png 768w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-1536x1229.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ouagadougou_EN-2048x1639.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We were pleased to have an opportunity to interview Construction Manager Abdramane Kone, who oversaw the work on a project which is crucial for the country&#8217;s economic activity.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":3852,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.4 -
