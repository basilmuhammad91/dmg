<p>To design and build the huge backup tank (an impressively dimensioned cylinder with a diameter of 56 metres, built underground at a depth of 30 metres under the Ganay stadium, which can receive 50,000 m3 in one hour), Chantiers Modernes Sud and Campenon Bernard Sud-Est worked in a joint venture with Soletanche Bachy on the €43.7 million project.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Built more than a century and a half ago, the needle dams on the Aisne and Meuse Rivers are difficult and dangerous for Voie Navigable de France (VNF) to operate and need to be rebuilt and upgraded.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The large-scale river infrastructure automation plan, which covers four&nbsp;<em>départements</em>&nbsp;and 41 municipalities, is being carried out under a public private partnership. This first PPP contract for river works has a value of €312 million and runs for 30 years, including five years of works. It was signed in 2013 with special purpose vehicle Bameo, jointly held by VINCI Concessions (50%), investment fund Meridiam and Shema (EDF Group).</p>



<p>In 2016, Bameo signed a first operation contract with the Corebam joint venture made up of four VINCI Construction France subsidiaries. It covers replacement of 29 manually operated dams with modern, automated dams and the modification of two further dams. Located on the Aisne and Meuse Rivers, they will be part of a comprehensive automated operating system to be implemented by VINCI Energies.</p>



<p>The technique, used for the first time in France for inland waterway dams, will consist in fitting the dams with water-filled inflatable barriers. Some dams will also be fitted with innovative Very Low Head (VLH) hydroelectric turbines to supply a total of 15 million kWh.</p>



<h4>Environmental goals</h4>



<p></p>



<p>To protect the environment each of these structures will be fitted with a fish ladder, with particular attention to architecture and landscape.</p>



<p>The dams are set to begin operating in 2020.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Work to reinforce the water distribution system is designed to expand access to drinking water for local residents regularly faced with water shortages due to lack of infrastructure investment and maintenance, and to improve the continuity and quality of the urban water supply.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.sogea-satom.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sogea-Satom</a> began work in April 2016 to reinforce the drinking water distribution network in the northern Abidjan district of Abobo. Handover of the 54-km pipeline system is scheduled in October 2017.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, work to extend the drinking water network in the southern part of Abidjan got under way in November 2016. The project provides for construction of 116 kilometres of PVC pipelines. Financed by the French Development Agency under the Debt Reduction and Development Contract, the project is expected to take 19 months to complete.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The city of Glasgow, Scotland, protects itself from flooding and pollution of the River Clyde.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>, working in a 50-50 joint venture with Costain, is building the Shieldhall Tunnel in Glasgow, United Kingdom, for Scotland’s public water systems operator Scottish Water.</p>



<p>The structure, Scotland’s largest wastewater storage tunnel, is designed to improve water quality and forestall the risk of flooding and improve water quality in the River Clyde.</p>



<p>The €105 million contract covers construction of two 15 metre diameter shafts with a depth of 20 metres, a 300 metre long cut-and-cover and a 5 km tunnel with an inside diameter of 4.70 metres.</p>



<h4>Successful start of the Daisy tunnel boring machine</h4>



<p></p>



<p>In July 2016 VINCI Construction Grands Projets began underground tunnel boring works in Glasgow. Daisy, the most recent addition to its family of earth pressure balanced shield tunnel boring machines, began work by safely boring through former coal mines.</p>



<p>Handover of the structure is scheduled in early 2018.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Like many rivers supplying large urban areas, the Thames was in need of major sewer works to combat pollution. The project set an example.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Lee Tunnel, built by the MVB joint venture (which includes <a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a> and <a href="https://www.bacsol.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bachy Soletanche Ltd</a>), was officially opened at the end of 2016.</p>



<p>The 7 km tunnel, dug at depths ranging from 55 to 75 metres, comprises five large shafts (20 to 40 metre diameter, 75 to 100 metre depth), associated with six mega-pumps with a unit capacity of 3 cu. metres/second.</p>



<p>The outsized structure will reduce the amount of wastewater discharged to the Thames every year by 16 million tonnes (i.e. 40%) by capturing it at source for treatment at Europe’s largest wastewater treatment plant in Beckton.</p>



<h4>The project continues with the Tideway programme</h4>



<p></p>



<p>The success of the exemplary Lee Tunnel project was followed in mid-2015 by the award of the East works package of the Tideway programme in London to a joint venture made up of VINCI Construction Grands Projets, Costain and Soletanche Bachy’s UK subsidiary Bachy Soletanche. Work on the new 25-km tunnel got under way in early 2016. It is also designed to limit the amount of untreated wastewater discharges to the Thames.</p>



<p>The East works package is one of three making up the project and covers construction of two tunnel sections with lengths of 5.5 and 4.6 km to carry wastewater and rainwater from the eastern part of the capital. The contract also includes the construction of five large shafts, marine works in the Thames estuary, connections with existing water collection structures and electromechanical works.</p>



<p>In 2015, the Lee Tunnel received the highest distinction awarded by the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS), the benchmark social and environmental evaluation organisation in the United Kingdom. &nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Because of Jamaica’s very uneven precipitation, improving access to drinking water is a crucial goal throughout the country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Replacement, renovation and construction of water facilities are challenging for Jamaica because the tropical climate causes very uneven precipitation from one region to another.</p>



<p>In its 15-year partnership with the National Water Commission, <a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a> has worked on projects designed to provide people in Jamaica with improved access to water resources over much of the island, including Kingston, the northwest parishes, Lucea, and Montego Bay for drinking water production and distribution systems and Mona &amp; Hope and Bogue for treatment plant upgrades.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dams on the Nile, designed to generate electricity, irrigate fields and ensure shipping on the iconic river, remain outsized undertakings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Four years after the handover of the Naga Hammadi dam on the Nile, the Egyptian authorities awarded to <a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a> the contract to build the new Assiut Barrage about 250 kilometres north of Luxor, designed to replace another dam built 400 metres upstream in the early 20th century.</p>



<p>Equipped with double locks, the dam will ensure shipping on the Nile, irrigate nearly 700,000 hectares of land as far as Cairo and generate electricity (32 MW via four 8 MW turbines). <a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a> has gradually restored the course of the river after creating a temporary bypass during the works in order to build the dam on dry land.</p>



<p>The dam began filling in November 2016 following five years of works.</p>
