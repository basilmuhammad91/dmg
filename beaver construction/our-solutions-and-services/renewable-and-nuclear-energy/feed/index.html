										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In Trairi, a city in northeastern Brazil’s Cearà state, Freyssinet completed the innovative lifting operations at the Trairi II wind energy complex, which is designed to bring down the price of energy.</p>



<p>Freyssinet designed and built the foundations and the 36 towers made of prestressed precast concrete with a height of 120 metres. The towers were erected with a tool specially designed for the operation called Eolift®. The method, which does not require a crane, is unique and is based on a hydraulic lifting technique long employed in civil engineering. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The original Tremblay en France heating network shafts, drilled in 1983, have reached the end of their service life. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fed by a geothermal doublet using the Dogger limestone aquifer lying at a depth of about 2,000 metres and with a water temperature ranging from 55°C to 80°C, the heating network needed a new heat doublet (production and injection shafts) to replace the existing outdated system. Entrepose Drilling drilled the new doublet to a depth of 2,000 metres to tap the hot water layer in 2015.</p>



<p>In parallel with the commissioning of the new shaft, work was started in 2016 to permanently close the shafts sunk in 1983. The project was awarded to Entrepose Drilling. Its teams began work at the site in October 2016. The work, scheduled to take between three and four months to complete, will close off the facility in accordance with best practices applying to wells and shafts.</p>



<p>Tremblay en France opted to continue geothermal operations for a period of 30 years. The natural energy source, which is both cost-effective and sustainable, will generate space and hot water heating for some 4,300 housing units in the city centre and for several public facilities.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[ITER is one of the largest nuclear research projects in the world. Located in Cadarache, near Aix-en-Provence, its huge tokamak reactor heralds the nuclear energy reactor of the future]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iter.org/">ITER</a>&nbsp;(International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project is a unique example of international cooperation in the search for an inexhaustible source of safe and environmentally-friendly energy. Europe, China, South Korea, India, Japan, Russia and the United States are working together to research the possibility of harnessing the energy from fusion, reproducing the reaction that lights up the stars.</p>



<p>This would involve demonstrating that the fusion of two types of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) in a tokamak reactor could become a viable energy source and generate electricity. From this starting point, the reactor aims to produce 10 times more energy than it takes to trigger nuclear fusion. So for 50MW of electricity consumed, ITER will generate 500MW of thermal energy.</p>



<h3>A world-class project in Cadarache (south of France)</h3>



<p></p>



<p>A consortium led by VINCI (58.3%), with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dodincampenonbernard.fr/">Dodin Campenon Bernard</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/">VINCI Construction France</a>&nbsp;has concluded an agreement with Fusion for Energy (F4E), the European Union organisation responsible for ensuring Europe&#8217;s contribution to the ITER project, for the construction of the tokamak reactor building and the design-construction of nine support buildings on the Cadarache site, north of Aix-en-Provence.</p>



<p>The main building will house the reactor, a cylinder, 28m in diameter, 29m high and weighing 23,000 tonnes. With its two support buildings, the tokamak will be housed in a reinforced concrete structure 120m long, 80m wide and 80m high. Other support buildings include the assembly building, a two-storey building and various industrial buildings. The reactor is equipped with large nuclear doors (4m x 4m, 40 tonnes), resistant to radiation and excessive pressure. The VINCI Group companies were responsible for raising the steel frame, weighing 800 tonnes, on the roof of the assembly building.</p>

<h3>Protecting ITER from seismic events – a challenge taken on by VINCI Construction Grands Projets</h3>



<p></p>



<p>In order to have the necessary infrastructure from the start of the installation project, VINCI Construction Grands Projets dug a seismic isolation pit 126m long, 86m wide and 15m deep. The purpose of this pit was to allow the construction of a first slab, as well as retaining walls. On top of this slab, 493 concrete pillars were positioned, each topped off by a seismic pad and capable of absorbing lateral movements of 10cm, making it possible to contain ground movements in the event of seismic activity. A second slab above these pads forms the floor of the ITER tokamak complex.</p>



<h3>7 November 2019: ITER reaches a milestone</h3>



<p></p>



<p>The completion, on deadline, of the important civil engineering works stage was symbolically marked by the concreting, on 7 November 2019, of the last pad of the upper level of the tokamak building. The teams still on site will be able to move to the next stage – installation of the metal roof structure – thereby staying on schedule to produce the first plasma, the energy generating element, in 2025.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em><strong>ITER is a one-of-a-kind research programme in terms of its complexity, precision and size.</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p><em>“ITER is a one-of-a-kind research programme in terms of its complexity, precision and size. With ITER, we are humbly helping to implement one of the greatest and most ambitious energy projects of our time, designed to make electricity available throughout the world without CO2 emissions or radiological risk. For us, as a builder, it is a matter of great pride to have laid the cornerstone of a structure of such importance to humanity,” </em>said Jérôme Stubler, Chairman of VINCI Construction.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Three decades after the catastrophe in Chernobyl, a confinement has been built to ensure site safety for the next 100 years and make it possible to begin dismantling the Unit 4 reactor that exploded in April 1986]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 29 November 2016, ceremony was held to mark the end of the positioning and the installation of the containment structure above the damaged reactor and the original containment structure built as an emergency measure following the explosion of nuclear reactor 4 in April 1986.</p>



<p>Designed and built by VINCI Construction, it is the largest mobile metal arch ever built. The figures are staggering:&nbsp;<strong>the dome measures 105 metres high and 150 metres long</strong>, and its steel structure weighs<strong>&nbsp;36,000 tonnes&nbsp;</strong>(fully fitted), including 25,000 tonnes of steel.&nbsp; Funded by 27 countries, the European Union and the EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development), this project will have involved more than 2,000 employees within the Novarka consortium led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/fr/">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>.</p>



<h4>The Chernobyl shelter structure must withstand extreme climate conditions for a century</h4>



<p></p>



<p>This project of rare technical complexity is totally unlike any other, was begun in 2010 and has involved more than 17 million hours of construction work. In terms of safety,&nbsp;<strong>it has been designed to withstand not only tornadoes and earthquakes for 100 years, but also extreme temperatures</strong>&nbsp;(from -43°C to +45°C).</p>



<p>The site now has equipment and systems in place to enable the future dismantling of reactor 4. This work will now be possible under conditions that ensure maximum flexibility and safety and minimum human involvement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="720" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tchernobyl24.jpeg" alt="tchernobyl" class="wp-image-2876" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tchernobyl24.jpeg 720w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tchernobyl24-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tchernobyl24-150x150.jpeg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption>Confinement for the Chernobyl sarcophagus – © Francis Vigouroux </figcaption></figure>



<h4>The priority: protecting the teams against radiation</h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Radiation protection was the non-negotiable starting point for developing the construction methods used.</strong>&nbsp;Since exposure to radiation is lower at ground level, this is where the majority of work took place. The first half of the arch was initially assembled on the ground west of the damaged reactor before being assembled in three successive lifts. The same method was used to raise the second half of the arch.</p>



<p>Since the entire worksite is located in a high-risk area, the central challenge was to guarantee quality standards, at the same time as maintaining maximum safety. For this reason, the design and construction methods used have complied fully with the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle. This principle is an extension of the precautionary principle of radiation protection: individuals exposed to toxic risks must be exposed at the lowest level reasonably achievable. For example, for some tasks &#8211; particularly those close to the shelter structure &#8211; personnel had to work behind concrete or lead screens. The work areas for the assembly and lifting of the arch were decontaminated, with personnel protected by appropriate clothing. A team of 60 people was dedicated to employee radiation protection.</p>



<p><br>Delivering such an unusual prototype project demanded the recruitment of skills from all over the world, with the result that people of more than 25 different nationalities were permanently present on-site, requiring multicultural management skills.</p>
