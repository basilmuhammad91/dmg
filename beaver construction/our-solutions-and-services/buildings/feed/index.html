					<description><![CDATA[West of the port of Sydney, Soletanche Bachy and Menard are helping to convert the Barangaroo industrial area into a mixed-use residential and retail complex in a huge project covering 22 hectares.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Barangaroo site, a highly polluted former industrial area, calls for innovative methods to meet its many technical and environmental challenges. After completing the foundations for high-rise buildings anchored at a depth of more than 25 metres and building the peripheral wall, the Soletanche Bachy major projects division joined Menard and AFS Bachy Soletanche to win two further contracts in 2016 to build the retaining walls for a soil remediation and construction project.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[New twin towers now grace the Kuala Lumpur skyline. Following handover of the first Berjaya Central Park high-rise building, also called the Menara Bangkok Bank for the largest buyer in June 2015, the second was completed at the end of 2016.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Berjaya Central Park residential and office complex (which has a total of 185,000 sq. metres of floor area across both towers) reaches a height of 200 metres. The second tower, built on a general contracting basis, now houses the five-star Ritz Carlton hotel. The reinforced concrete post-tensioned flat slab structure uses an alternative design. The entire facade consists of curtain walling.</p>



<p>This is VINCI Construction’s second successful project for the Berjaya Group following handover of the Berjaya Times Square project, one of the Malaysian capital’s largest shopping centres, in 2003.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Inaugurated at the end of 2015, the 170-metre Odeon Tower overlooks the beaches in Monaco.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Odeon Tower offers residents of the Principality 100,000 sq. metres of high-end retail and residential space. The foundations were one of the major challenges in building the high-rise, which has a footprint of only 3,000 sq. metres on a steep slope.</p>



<p>To meet the delivery schedule, the “top and down” construction method was used to build the 10 underground parking levels and the 49 storeys of the building simultaneously.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Freyssinet worked on the renovation of the MLC tower, a standout feature of the Sydney, Australia skyline. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The MLC tower, a historic 220 metre building with more than 60 storeys, had suffered the ravages of time since it was built in 1977. It has now been given a new lease on life. The project included an assessment of the condition of the outside facade, restoration of the performance and strength of the facade elements, restoration of the building&#8217;s appearance and provision of a specific maintenance plan.</p>



<p>To renovate the 35,000 sq. metre facade, the Freyssinet teams applied a range of solutions, including cathodic protection of the reinforcing bars and application of a waterproof silane surface treatment.</p>



<h4>Rejuvenating the building while minimising disruption for occupants</h4>



<p></p>



<p>Since the building remained occupied during the project, a major effort was made to minimise disruption for local residents, including encapsulation of the work areas and specially developed work platforms. Overall, the noise level was reduced by 25 dB. The “facelift” restored the iconic building to its former glory as part of the Sydney skyline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new five-star luxury hotel epitomises high-end building in the heart of Paris.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The challenge of the The Peninsula hotel project in Paris was to extensively restructure the building using state-of-the-art techniques and innovative processes while retaining its historic features. The in-depth renovation of the former International Conference Centre operated by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs marks the return of French luxury hotels around the Champs-Élysées.</p>



<p>The project opted for the “top and down” method to simultaneously carry out the work on the three underground levels and the superstructure. To complete the colossal project – 40,000 sq. metres, 200 rooms including eight suites, restaurants including a panoramic space, boutiques and a spa with swimming pool – up to 1,000 people worked at the site at the same time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The hotel complex in the heart of Paris’s La Défense business district opened in February 2015. VINCI Construction came up with ingenious solutions to implement its design.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Méliá Hotel’s smooth, glazed surface faces the historical Place de l’Etoile &#8211; Porte Maillot &#8211; La Défense Grande Arche axis. The Spanish Meliá Group designed the new four-star structure as its flagship hotel in France.</p>



<p>The “knife blade” shaped building plays on contrasting materials: glass on the southern esplanade-side facade and metallic shot-peened panels on the boulevard side. The fluid, curved southern facade ends in a prow with a tilted overhanging edge projecting towards Paris.</p>



<h4>A hotel built on virtually invisible land</h4>



<p></p>



<p>Built like a bridge spanning several tunnels, the design called for ingenious solutions on the part of VINCI Construction. Located on the spot where a ventilation plant for the A14 motorway previously stood, the 1,600 sq. metre land take is hemmed in by the circular boulevard, the La Défense esplanade and a car park exit. The building straddles two tunnels, a car park exit and a ventilation shaft like a bridge. It rests on special foundations built across the Défense 2 car park between the various tunnels.</p>



<p>The 25-level high-rise received a SIMI 2015 Grand Prize.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The new PLENDI brand by VINCI Construction helps meet the increasing demand for luxury hotel projects, particularly in major world capitals like London.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An integrated project management team refurbished the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park in London under a Pre-Construction Services Agreement (PCSA) with the client in which PLENDI made a range of commitments to provide services prior to the start of construction and thus take part in design studies and project preparation. A team of interior decorators was assembled to participate in engineering and design very early in the project.</p>



<p>PLENDI by VINCI Construction is entirely dedicated to this type of project. It provides expert advice covering the full range of works involved in a high-end project, from design to handover. A team of construction engineers and interior space specialists – craftspeople, decorators and interior designers – deliver a comprehensive range of expertise. The integrated approach is reassuring for clients and makes it possible to better meet the specifications, budget and schedule at all project stages, with the meticulous attention to detail that makes for all the difference.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h4>Building Information Modelling (BIM), a central feature</h4>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>To optimise this hotel-rehabilitation project, innovation was given pride of place. Accordingly, VINCI Construction Grands Projets made the use of&nbsp;<strong>Building Information Modelling (BIM)</strong>&nbsp;a central feature of the project, thereby facilitating the client’s decisions throughout the mandate. Right from the design phase, BIM accelerates project processes through the use of 3D models and collaborative work methods, leading to more effective development decisions.<br>In the works phase, BIM optimises all worksite operations.<br>Since the work is being carried out at a busy site, the digital model helps to forecast problems in the day-to-day operational management of the hotel and handle scheduling and sequencing tasks (including the comings and goings of work teams) more efficiently. As a result, the client will benefit from all the advantages of BIM in the operational phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The conversion of the Macdonald warehouse in Paris's 19th arrondissement next to the ring road is a major part of the Paris North East urban renewal programme.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction France teams completed the conversion of the former Macdonald warehouse in the 19th arrondissement in the summer of 2015. The former 617-metre long logistics hub was transformed into a new neighbourhood, a central component in the Paris North East urban renewal programme. The outsized project covers 165,000 sq. metres and comprises 1,126 housing units, 32,000 sq. metres of retail space, 26,000 sq. metres of office space, 16,000 sq. metres of activity space, 17,000 sq. metres of community facilities (gymnasium, day care centre and middle school) and 1,300 parking spaces.</p>



<p>The new multipurpose complex is designed to accommodate 2,500 residents and 3,000 employees. VINCI Construction France worked with six property developers and 10 architectural firms to complete the exceptional project, which included infrastructure (notably a tram line passage) and superstructure works.</p>
