					<description><![CDATA[Construction of 400 km of onshore gas pipelines between Greece and Albania will ultimately secure long-term gas transport from the Caucasus to Europe.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gas pipelines are a reliable and cost-effective way to transport natural gas from the wellhead to the consumer. Once connected to the Trans Anatolian Pipeline at the Greek-Turkish border and to the Italian natural gas network, the 878-km TransAdriatic Pipeline will bring natural gas from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz II field to Europe.</p>



<p>After taking part in two high-profile projects – the PNG LNG project in Papua New Guinea as part of an Exxon-led consortium, and the Incahuasi project in Bolivia as part of a Total-led consortium – Spiecapag will now build one of the three sections of the 185 km onshore gas pipeline between Kipoi and Kavala, Greece under an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) contract for the Pipeline AG international consortium. It will also build two other pipeline sections with a combined length of 215 km between Bilisht and Topojë, Albania.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.entrepose.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entrepose Contracting</a> and <a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a> teams completed civil engineering works for the construction of four double-walled cryogenic tanks designed to store liquefied natural gas on the Yamal Peninsula in the far north of Russia, one of the world’s coldest regions, 600 km from the Arctic Circle. The electromechanical work continues. The hard surfaces for tanks 1 and 2 (each of which weighs more than 700 tonnes) and the pipe racks were successfully installed just before Christmas in temperatures below -40°C. The project is set for completion in 2017, ahead of the contractual delivery date. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The world’s first large-capacity underground helium storage facility has been commissioned for Air Liquide.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With the inauguration of the first commercial pure helium storage site in September 2016, Air Liquide provided a solution to the main issue facing the market for the noble gas: rapidly responding to customer demand. The challenge was to guarantee delivery times to customer sites, avoid losses due to helium heating during transport and secure the supply of helium *via *an efficient logistics system.</p>



<p>The challenge has now been met with the new storage site in Gronau-Epe, North Rhine-Westphalia, some 120 km from Düsseldorf. Helium is stored in large quantities at a depth of 1,300 metres in a salt cavern and the natural brine is used to adjust the storage volume. For UGS GmbH, a subsidiary of Geostock Holding (Entrepose Group), the adventure took place between November 2015 and July 2016. The challenge was to design a new specific helium storage shaft. The result is commensurate with the goal. The new site gives Air Liquide, world leader in helium since its acquisition of Airgas, a more reliable and more predictable supply system.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Geocean Protis barge was employed to deliver a turnkey solution for the offshore oil field in Benin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To better capitalise on its natural resources, Benin decided to expand the Sèmè-Kraké oil field.</p>



<p>As part of the offshore project, Geocean used the Geocean Protis barge to carry out a variety of operations, including installation of a 220-tonne CSP (Conductor Supported Platform), laying of three pipelines (production, export, treated water discharge) and construction of a CBM (Conventional Buoy Mooring) type export terminal.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Dunkirk LNG terminal now has three of the world’s largest cryogenic storage tanks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In response to the need for greater safety and more diverse means of energy supply in Europe, EDF launched the construction of a methane terminal at the Port of Dunkirk; the project will also increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) import capacity.</p>



<p>Entrepose Contracting built the three 190,000 cu. metre LNG storage tanks on a turnkey basis. They are among the world’s largest cryogenic storage tanks. Each full integrity tank has an inner steel (9% nickel) hull, which maintains LNG at a temperature of -163°C.</p>



<p>Several VINCI Construction subsidiaries pooled their complementary expertise to build a variety of structures at the site: a BOG (Boil-off Gas) building, a pumping station (Seawater Intake), two discharge tanks, a Qmax tanker jetty and an undersea tunnel to carry warm water from the Gravelines nuclear power station to the plant, and to carry out soil improvement works.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One of Australia’s largest natural resource development projects is located in the desert on the northwest coast of Western Australia.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction Grands Projets, Entrepose Contracting, Menard Bachy and Australia’s Thiess company built four LNG (liquefied natural gas) tanks in the desert of northwest Australia under an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) contract. The turnkey project is part of one of the country’s largest natural resource development programmes. It comprises creation of two double-walled LNG tanks with a unit storage capacity of 150,000 cu. metres and two condensate storage tanks with a unit capacity of 120,000 cu. metres. The roofs were airlifted onto the tanks.</p>



<p>The project, carried out in an extreme environment 1,500 km from the nearest urban centre, was completed in November 2016 after 4 million hours of works.</p>
