					<description><![CDATA[The handover of the road was one of the main preliminary steps preparing mining operations in the Simandou area, which harbours one of the world’s largest iron ore deposits.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Built in to support the iron ore mining project at Simandou in the forests of Guinea 800 km from Conakry, the road between two large prefectures in the region, Beyla and N’Zérékoré, was handed over in 2016.</p>



<p>The refurbishment of the 128-km road, which was previously virtually impassable, was financed by Anglo-Australian mining group Rio Tinto. Built by Sogea-Satom teams, the project involved a large amount of excavation (850,000 cu. metres) and backfill (350,000 cu. metres) and was subject to the very high environmental and labour standards required by the IFC (World Bank), the Rio Tinto partner. The Simandou project is the largest combined mining operation and rail, port and auxiliaries project carried out in Africa to date.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To support a sharp increase in production at the Cerro Verde copper mine, Terre Armée built 33.80 metre high walls for two primary crushers to facilitate dumper traffic.</p>



<p>A total of 4,400 sq. metres of Reinforced Earth® walls were erected using GeoStrap® reinforcements. Terre Armée also provided technical support and supplied the materials.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Supporting the development of an open-pit mine in the municipality of Yaté designed to process mineral resources.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Vale Nouvelle-Calédonie open-pit mine in the southern part of Grande Terre constitutes one of New Caledonia’s largest laterite ore deposits.</p>



<p>Following initial development of the mine, VINCI Construction Dom-Tom began further work in 2013 to build a 60-metre tailings pile (for materials with no nickel content) with a storage capacity of 20,000 m3 per day. The company adapted to the mining sector constraints of continuous 24/7 operation under all weather conditions. The large-scale project employed 160 people at peak activity.</p>
