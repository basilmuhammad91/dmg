More than 500 engineers and technicians, including the joint venture\u2019s designers, worked successfully to reach this milestone today and enable the project to switch from design to construction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanning on approximately 90km, the delivery of Lot N1 and Lot N2 will include an impressive number of engineering structures, tunnels and earthworks: 51 viaducts and boxes totalling over 14km and 76&nbsp;overbridges, 7.5km of twin tunnel, 35 cuttings reaching over 30km, 76 culverts and other underbridges, 66 embankments reaching over 33km, 4 motorway crossings requiring box structures, and 6 interfaces with existing rail requiring both dive-under and overbridge structures. Lots N1 and N2 comprise a total of 1.8 million cubic meters of concrete and 32 million cubic meters of cut and landfill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work will start on site in summer 2020 with all the sanitary and safety rules that prevail according to the Covid-19 pandemic and would last 74 months. At the peak of activity, the project will employ 10,000 people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contract awards reflect the innovative and collaborative nature of this long-established and successful joint venture. Balfour Beatty\u2019s in-depth knowledge and expertise of British transport is complemented with VINCI\u2019s major project expertise, including the recently completed SEA Tours-Bordeaux high-speed line in France and rail infrastructure projects in the UK.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balfour Beatty &#8211; VINCI teamed up with Systra and Mott MacDonald and was awarded in September 2019 by HS2 the contract for the construction management of Old Oak Common station in London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>* VINCI is represented by its subsidiaries: VINCI Construction Grands Projets, VINCI Construction UK and VINCI Construction Terrassement. &nbsp;<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vinci.com\/vinci.nsf\/en\/press-releases\/pages\/20200415-0806.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">View the press release<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The 50:50 joint venture between Balfour Beatty and VINCI* has been awarded the HS2 lots N1 and N2 phase 2 contract (construction) on 1 April 2020.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":3171,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.4 -
