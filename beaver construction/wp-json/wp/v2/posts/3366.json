Teams have been working since September on the demolition of the existing plant, prior to the design-build phase for the new plant which will see the production of drinking water there increase from 20,000 to 52,000\u202fcu. metres a day. The works will take two years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second contract, worth about \u20ac8.8 million, was also signed this summer, with SRWSA, the water authority in Siem Reap, for the city\u2019s water treatment plant. It covers the design-build of a water intake structure (30,000 cu. metres\/day), increasing the existing plant\u2019s drinking-water production capacity by 15,000 cu. metres\/day and the laying of a 6.5 km-long connecting pipe. In total, 14 months of works and a four-month commissioning period have been scheduled.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Vietnam, meanwhile, August 2017 saw VINCI Construction Grands Projets secure, together with Bessac (Soletanche Freyssinet), the design-build contract for the construction of a 10 km-long pipe to supply treated water to the centre of Ho Chi Minh City, the country\u2019s economic capital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Valued at some \u20ac60 million, it covers the detailed design of the project, the manufacture of the prefabricated pipe elements in reinforced concrete (external diameter: 3 m) and their installation using the pipe jacking technique, and the creation of 16 shafts, 11 connections and 5 branch sockets for future connections to the network. Lasting three-and-a-half years, this project will rely on the combined expertise of VINCI Construction Grands Projets in the management of hydraulic projects and Bessac in the field of micro-tunnelling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last five years, the structures created worldwide by VINCI Construction Grands Projets have made possible the production of a million cu.\u202fmetres of drinking water a day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following its delivery of the extension to the Niroth plant in Phnom Penh in early 2017, this summer VINCI Construction Grands Projets signed a further contract for the Cambodian capital with PPWSA, the Phnom Penh water authority.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":3367,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.4 -
