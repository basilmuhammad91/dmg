The new project is located at the heart of the Quartier des Terrasses, opposite the future Quartier des Groues. The works will be executed by VINCI Construction France with VINCI Energies in charge of the implementation of environmental certificates and labels for the office component and will be completed in autumn 2020.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new contract calls for the construction of three buildings, designed as a window onto the city by Maud Caubet Architectes and Quadrifiore Architecture. Located near the U Arena and new Nanterre-La Folie station (Line E of the RER regional express system and Line 15 of the Grand Paris Express system), the Origine complex contributes to the development of Nanterre&#8217;s Quartier des Terrasses and Quartier des Groues, which are destined to become the links between the city and the La D\u00e9fense business district.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two buildings, each with nine storeys and a total surface area of 70,000 sq. metres of office space, will be connected via three underground levels, including two parking levels. On the ground floor, there will be a restaurant shared by all companies, an auditorium, gym and so on. The storeys above the entrance will be cantilevered, supported by a part that is also suspended. This architectural and technical challenge will be made possible by the installation of a metal load-bearing frame weighing 220 tonnes. From the interior garden, it will be possible to see eight storeys of the concrete-wood structure. The office complex will be completed by loggias, making it very light and open to the exterior. The third building, with 10 storeys and a surface area of 10,000 sq. metres, will comprise 145 housing units, a cr\u00e8che and retail outlets.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"845\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/origine_nanterre.jpg\" alt=\"Origine nanterre\" class=\"wp-image-3155\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/origine_nanterre.jpg 845w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/origine_nanterre-300x178.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/origine_nanterre-768x454.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An innovative, virtuous project<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VINCI Construction France and VINCI Energies teams will execute the entire Origine project in full BIM&nbsp;(Building Information Modelling), which gives the various participants access to all site information in real time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time in France, Origine aims to achieve a very high environmental performance combining four certifications (HQE 2016 with an Excellent rating, BREEAM with an Excellent rating, LEED with a Gold rating and WELL with a Silver rating), as well as two quality labels (Biodiversity and E+C-), a first in France. The project includes the installation of 2,800 solar panels for lighting and geothermal boreholes for heating.
