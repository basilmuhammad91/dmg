Genvia technology design will enable a 30% higher electricity conversion efficiency per kg of hydrogen produced, bringing the&nbsp;cost of producing clean hydrogen down to a level that competes aggressively with other sources of energy. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging Schlumberger technology industrialization experience, the first Genvia manufacturing pilot line will be established at a Schlumberger manufacturing facility in B\u00e9ziers in 2021. Genvia will also set up a Technology Centre co-located with the CEA in Grenoble, France, to accelerate the maturing of the technology through the industrialization process. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genvia will participate in a series of demonstration projects with partners in different use cases for the industrial, energy and mobility sectors. These demonstration projects will pave the way for the development of the full value chain for the utilization of hydrogen as the clean energy carrier of choice. The different demonstration projects are expected to range from 300 kW systems in 2023 to larger systems with megawatt capacities in 2024.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the results of the pilot line and demonstration projects, investment into the building of a giga factory for the production of solid oxide electrolyzer and fuel cell stacks is expected to launch in 2025. The production ramp of the giga factory will enable Genvia to meet the gigawatt deliveries of electrolyzers and fuel cells, which the market is anticipated to demand at an accelerated pace in 2030 and beyond.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Schlumberger New Energy<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schlumberger is the world&#8217;s leading provider of technology to the global energy industry.
