In 2015, our subsidiary accounted for 13% of VINCI Construction\u2019s overall business activity in Latin America, with revenue of \u20ac93 million. We have four regional offices located in Mexico City, Monterrey in the northeast, Guadalajara near the west coast and Villahermosa in the south of the country. We offer the full range of construction and repair techniques for buildings and infrastructure, post-tensioning, cable stays and cabled structures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our offering includes construction,comprehensive repair and reinforcement of bridge structures. We have already built nearly 100 bridges in this country and repaired more than 4,000. For example, in 2015 we completed the rebuilding of the Coyuca bridge (with Cemisa) and the El Cuajilote bridge in the State of Guerrero, and built the Tetiteco bridge in the State of Nayarit. We are continuing construction of a bridge in increments of 50 metres that will ultimately be 425 metres long, and a cantilevered bridge on the Toluca-Naucalpan motorway. In 2016, public spending on road transport infrastructure projects was cut back and spending shifted towards large key infrastructure projects such as the new Mexico City airport and the Mexico City-Toluca railway. Against that backdrop, the growing use of public private partnerships (PPPs) and asociaciones p\u00fablico-privadas (APPs) is opening up new private- sector markets. We intend to make the most of these opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freyssinet began operating in Mexico 51 years ago.
