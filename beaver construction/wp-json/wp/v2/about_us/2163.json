It therefore strives to support and advise those of its clients wishing to include nature in their projects. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.equo-vivo.com\/\"><strong>Equo Vivo<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.urbalia.fr\/\"><strong>Urbalia<\/strong><\/a> were launched in 2017 to meet this goal. Equo Vivo delivers ecological engineering solutions and services, with an exclusive focus on protecting and restoring biodiversity, designing and building ecological facilities and maintaining ecological continuity. Urbalia, which was jointly created with AgroParisTech, is a start-up dedicated to integrating biodiversity and urban agriculture in urban development projects. It notably uses Biodi(V)strict, the first tool for measuring the biodiversity potential of an urban project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"610\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1-1024x610.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1-300x179.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1-768x457.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1-1536x914.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/activskeen-photo-andreas_horsky_panoramique-1.jpg 1680w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Building Integrated Photovoltaic Technologies &#8211; ActivSkeen<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Eco-design becomes the norm<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The fight against global warming calls for adapting cities and saving substantial amounts of energy. Buildings, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, must become responsible. As a design-build company, VINCI Construction strives to be strongly involved in addressing eco-design and energy efficiency issues. Several innovations with promising potential have been developed to serve the building\u2019s end users and visitors. For example, new generations of eco-designed positive-energy buildings are set to become energy hubs within the urban landscape. Similarly, new Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic solutions are emerging. Another promising solution is Greenfloor, the ventilated concrete slab that acts as a radiant ceiling, which was co-developed with VINCI Energies to provide thermal inertia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the energy transition, VINCI Construction is committed to reducing the environmental footprint of its buildings. To achieve that goal, it created <a href=\"https:\/\/eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https:\/\/activskeen.com\/&amp;data=02|01|julien.thiboust@vinci-construction.com|580264ac27d44152582a08d7f00500ab|9873183240da45469203f68390800051|0|0|637241776579823732&amp;sdata=coDvZEs4rxYpWEVU+SRv5TEEoRtRiIaJvNJLjN597RQ=&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ActivSkeen<\/a>. This subsidiary company focuses on the rollout of Building Integrated Photovoltaic Technologies (BIPT) and the installation of dynamic glazing solutions. Together, these two techniques will ultimately transform building envelopes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined solution is encouraging the development of energy-positive buildings that will contribute to the energy self-sufficiency of entire blocks and even communities. At the end of 2018, ActivSkeen acquired glass construction specialist <a href=\"https:\/\/eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com\/?url=https:\/\/www.ertex-solar.at\/fr\/&amp;data=02|01|julien.thiboust@vinci-construction.com|580264ac27d44152582a08d7f00500ab|9873183240da45469203f68390800051|0|0|637241776579833729&amp;sdata=n3gtWPhPRTGIQ6hDX5BahzsLrtvJfR\/8GmnsONSRWJE=&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ertex Solar<\/a>&nbsp;to offer a broad spectrum of aesthetic high-performance photovoltaic solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>The circular economy makes headway<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"588\" src=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/module-14_ligne-12_voie-fluviale-1paris.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/module-14_ligne-12_voie-fluviale-1paris.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/module-14_ligne-12_voie-fluviale-1paris-300x176.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.vinci-construction.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/module-14_ligne-12_voie-fluviale-1paris-768x452.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the circular economy is to do more wih less. It achieves this by optimising the use of natural resources and limiting waste. In a move to take on this approach, VINCI Construction has begun to re-think its construction, supply and consumption methods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several steps were taken in this direction in 2017, including alternative transport options that replaced road haulage to remove worksite rubble from worksites such as the Samaritaine project and the Line 12 metro extension in Paris, for which river barge transport was introduced; use of recycled plant waste to generate electricity in Africa with VINCI Environnement; and reduced waste production and optimised water and energy consumption across all VINCI Construction companies<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Renewable energy with the wind at its back<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of its sustainable development strategy, VINCI Construction developed a wide range of renewable energy initiatives in 2017. Freyssinet, for example, designed the Eolift\u00ae process, which involves assembly on the ground to increase the height of wind turbines without the use of a crane. The technique was used at the Trairi II wind farm in Brazil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vinci-construction-maritime-fluvial.fr\/fr\/\">VINCI Construction Maritime et Fluvial<\/a> was set up to provide an integrated range of solutions and services for renewable marine energy. Entrepose also expanded its geothermal and anaerobic digestion expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, in early 2018 VINCI Construction won the contract to build a pumped storage hydroelectric plant near Agadir as part of Morocco\u2019s renewable energy development and integration plan.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>VINCI Construction works to support sustainable development with a special focus on combating climate change and efforts to reintroduce nature into the built environment.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":2020,"template":"","about_category":[53],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v15.4 -
