This is one of the main projects designed to improve the transportation network in the United States and VINCI\u2019s first road infrastructure PPP in that country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opening of the infrastructure to traffic marks the completion of four years of design-build construction work carried out by a consortium made up of Walsh Construction (60%) and VINCI Construction Grands Projets (40%).<br>The new infrastructure includes a 762-metre cable-stayed bridge over the Ohio River with two iconic diamond-shaped piers, which Sixense will monitor in real time; a 512-metre twin-bore tunnel on the Kentucky approach to the bridge; 19 standard engineering structures; and work to improve the road network and associated infrastructure. In terms of safety, the construction phase was completed successfully with more than 1,100 days worked without lost-time accident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Exemplary social, environmental and economic impact<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social and economic impact of the project, eagerly awaited for more than 50 years, is expected to include creation of several thousand jobs in the two states in coming years.
