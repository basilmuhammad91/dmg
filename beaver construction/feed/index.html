					<description><![CDATA[S2R, a VINCI Construction subsidiary on Reunion Island, is carrying out building decommissioning and refurbishment projects. The manager, Faouzi Ben-Abdallah, has for a long time been looking for  better ways to manage the waste generated by this type of operation. Over the past three years, the company has made progress in examining various solutions before going forward, with very encouraging results and prospects. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2><strong>How did S2R come to rethink the way it manages waste from its operations?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Faouzi Ben-Abdallah: </strong>For many years, I had been giving some thought to how we could redesign our waste management process. We came to an obvious conclusion when examining our building sites: demolition and refurbishment work generates enough rubble to fill a good number of skips. Sanitary appliances, tiles, windows, doors, paint, glue&#8230; a good third of what we put into the dumpster is still in good condition. Unfortunately, everything would go to the waste facility and end up in a landfill. We were really not happy with this. We did not want to sit idly by and decided to do something to change the situation. I got in touch with several people, including members of Synergie Péi, a non-profit organisation on Reunion Island which is working with regional authorities and businesses as part of an environmental sustainability initiative that promotes the recycling and reclaiming of residual materials. We got our heads together to work on viable solutions. Working with other businesses, we came up with the idea of a “building materials library”, i.e. a place where we could store the materials that still have life in them and sell them at bargain prices. So far though, we have not found a suitable place, nor the funds to cover the rental fee. Since we really wanted this project to take off, we came up with the idea of starting a yard sale.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brocante-lavabo-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4023" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brocante-lavabo-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brocante-lavabo-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brocante-lavabo-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brocante-lavabo-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>So how did the yard sale work?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Faouzi Ben-Abdallah: </strong>We decided on a temporary event, which settled the question of premises. It was a great success. We organised the first yard sale in November 2019 at the port, during the European Week for Waste Reduction. Everything was bought up in the space of three days! On our side, the proceeds from the sale were enough to cover all the costs of organising the event. We offered both used and unused materials from our worksites, which otherwise would have been destroyed and/or sent to a landfill. By selling them to private individuals and companies at bargain prices, we put them back in the loop. It is a real virtuous cycle as regards the materials, and a real service to buyers who can make significant savings. In 2020, we even accelerated the pace and started organising these yard sales on a monthly basis. To give you an idea of the volumes involved, approximately 7 tonnes of residual materials were sold at the 4 yard sales that took place between August and November, corresponding to more than 150 different assorted items, such as toilets, bathtubs, washbasins, lighting fixtures, doors, sinks, taps, kitchen countertops&#8230; Because of the current health protocols, we organised a time-slot reservation system in order to avoid crowds forming. And it worked very well.</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2><strong>What are the next steps?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Faouzi Ben-Abdallah: </strong>At the end of December 2020, we responded to the Call for Expressions of Interest issued by the Innovation Plan for the French Overseas Territories, which is part of the Investment Plan led by the General Secretariat for Investment. We set up this project with a number of other partners, including the University of Reunion Island, several research laboratories and the island’s main subsidised housing company. Entitled REHABILIS, the project aims to provide a sustainable solution to the problem of construction waste (fittings, furniture, materials, etc.) by turning this waste into a source of social and economic wealth. Our proposal focuses on three areas. Firstly, the circular economy: our goal is to organise the sector to make it easier to recover and recondition residual materials before putting them back into the loop by reselling them to private individuals or businesses. That is the idea behind the “materials library” for which we want to find a permanent location. This should lead to new jobs, as we will likely hire new employees as part of our social integration approach. The second area consists in converting waste into raw materials that can be reused on our worksites. An example is the residual glass wool from our worksites, which can be turned into a bio-composite thermal insulation material when combined with bio-sourced coconut fibres. Finally, the third area of focus is pilot projects. The idea is to identify construction projects on the island, to get in touch with the design team, and share with them the list of all available residual materials on our projects, such as sanitary appliances or windows. They would then be able to incorporate these low-cost materials into their designs. The “waste” that we produce would therefore be given a life extension. For the time being, we are waiting to find out if our project will be selected. But we are optimistic, because it offers relevant strategies that can have a true impact on the economy, on employment and on the environment, in a very short time.</p>

<p><strong>•&nbsp;26 April 1986 / </strong>Reactor number 4 at Chernobyl nuclear plant explodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>•&nbsp;1992&nbsp;/</strong>&nbsp;Ukraine launches a design contest for a shelter to confine the nuclear reactor and minimise all potential risk. Resolution, a European consortium led by Campenon Bernard SGE, wins the contest. The works are entrusted to Novarka, a consortium encompassing VINCI Construction Grands Projets (leader) and Bouygues Travaux Publics.</p>



<p><strong>•&nbsp;2010 /</strong>&nbsp;Works begin, led by VINCI Construction Grands Projets. The confinement arch is designed to protect dismantling work on the former sarcophagus and reactor ruins, while maximising protection for workers on site.</p>



<p><strong>• 2016&nbsp;/</strong>&nbsp;The arch is built in an area next to the reactor to protect teams from radiations. In November 2016, the are was slide on 327 metres, thanks to a special sliding system composed of 224 hydraulic cylinders, in order to cover the damaged reactor. It took 40 hours, spread over 5 days, to complete this operation. It is the largest land mobile structure built to date.</p>



<p><strong>• 2017</strong>&nbsp;/ Work is completed and the arch is handed over to confine, sort and stock short-lived waste, and stockpile radioactive waste.</p>



<p><strong>• 2019</strong> / Delivery of the project. This is the end of 12 years of extraordinary construction work under atypical conditions. More than 10,000 NOVARKA workers and technicians took turns working 33 million hours to complete the construction of the containment building for the damaged reactor No. 4.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Teams from Integrated Health Projects (IHP) – a joint venture between VINCI Construction UK and Sir Robert McAlpine – successfully converted Manchester Central Convention Complex into a 750-bed temporary hospital in under two weeks in spring 2020. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>IHP teams were officially given the green light on 28&nbsp;March&nbsp;2020 and, 12&nbsp;hours later, were ready to get started on the project. Working alongside the NHS and the Army, they began converting the huge hall, setting up one bed every 30&nbsp;minutes for two&nbsp;weeks. “What followed was like nothing else I have ever been involved with,” explains Garry Bowker, Regional Director of IHP and VINCI Construction UK.&nbsp; “We needed to address three priorities – sorting out key experts, lining up our supply chain, and organising a team to manage the design and installation of the works.” For instance, large quantities of materials and equipment needed to be purchased and transported very quickly for the project, including 14,000&nbsp;m² of flooring to transform the hall.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4><strong>A mock-up to confirm the bed bay layout</strong></h4>



<p>Construction companies, local authorities, the Army, the NHS and the entire supply chain worked hand in hand 24/7 for two&nbsp;weeks to meet the deadlines. According to John Fowler, Project Manager at VINCI Construction UK, “One of the key messages was: ‘Forget all you know about normal healthcare construction – this is about constant problem-solving.’” When his teams were ready to lay the flooring, the layout and exact dimensions of each bed bay had not yet been decided on. A full-scale mock-up bed bay was assembled to test out and confirm the dimensions based on healthcare professionals’ recommendations. To take medical constraints into account, the layout of the beds was marked out on the floor with tape, enabling everybody to visualise the points of detail. For instance, the three&nbsp;zones in the hospital had to be able to operate with staff and patients to move around without the Amber zone (a breakout space for staff) or the Green zone (for supplies and deliveries) entering into contact with the Red zone (the area with Covid patients). Less than two&nbsp;weeks after the go-ahead, a temporary facility, the Nightingale North West hospital, was ready for use on 13&nbsp;April. Equipped to receive coronavirus patients requiring treatment but not intensive care, the hospital immediately eased pressure on intensive care units in existing hospitals across the region.&nbsp;</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><strong>Alan Kondys, Healthcare sector director at VINCI Construction UK and Framework director at Integrated Health Projects explains:</strong><strong> </strong>“The seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic is putting pressure on the NHS, its clinicians, and key staff. IHP had no hesitation in responding to the call to deliver the Manchester surge facility, and we are working collaboratively under ProCure22*, which is supporting this initiative nationwide.”<strong></strong></p>



<p><em>* ProCure22 is the construction procurement framework administrated by the </em><em>NHS England &amp; NHSE Improvements.</em></p>



<p>Integrated Health Projects (IHP) is a joint venture between VINCI Construction UK and Sir Robert McAlpine. Providing development, design, construction and facility management services for healthcare facilities, IHP has successfully completed over 170&nbsp;projects since it was established in 2003.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We were pleased to have an opportunity to interview Construction Manager Abdramane Kone, who oversaw the work on a project which is crucial for the country's economic activity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In September 2020, 150 Sogea-Satom employees, of whom 95% were recruited locally, completed the construction of the Ouagadougou bus station in Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>The Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) bus station, as seen by Abdramane Kone, Construction Manager.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="614" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3849" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-1024x614.png 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-768x461.png 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1.png 1074w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The Ouagadougou bus station truly showcases Sogea-Satom&#8217;s expertise; with this project, we were able to demonstrate our skills in roadworks, building works and steel construction.”</p></blockquote>



<p></p>



<h4>Abdramane, you were in charge of the work on the Ouagadougou bus station. What makes this a complex project?</h4>



<p>Abdramane Kone: It is a <strong>new and complex project that departs from our usual jobs,</strong> but we were able to carry it out with a young team and 95% of locally recruited staff. The Ouagadougou bus station <strong>truly showcases Sogea-Satom&#8217;s expertise</strong>; through this project, we were able to demonstrate our skills in roadworks, building works and steel construction. We first built a <strong>temporary station </strong>to allow road hauliers to continue working. We then went on to build the station that you see today. We also built <strong>a boarding and loading platform and twenty or so buildings (including a two-storey building that can accommodate two additional storeys, as well as shops and restaurants), with roadworks around the station.</strong></p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>What are the benefits of the new bus station?</h4>



<p>A.K: The station is expected to become an economic hub for Ouagadougou and its surrounding area. Also, much care has been put into its design, which incorporates solutions that solve the sanitation and drainage issues that had been plaguing local residents for years.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>How has the environmental impact of the project been taken into account?</h4>



<p>A.K: We have installed special facilities. For example, on the boarding and loading platform, we installed renewable energy equipment comprising an <strong>integrated solar roof that generates 130 kW when running at peak</strong>. The system can power the entire station all day long.</p>



<div style="height:30px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h4>What was the highlight of this journey?</h4>



<p>A.K: There were <strong>several significant moments all along this journey, </strong>but if I had to single out only one, it would be the day when the people living near the station and the future occupants came as a delegation to thank us for having improved their living environment and solved the problems they had been experiencing for several years.</p>



<p>A sense of accomplishment, of a job well done: that’s what I felt when those residents came to thank us. It is also one of the reasons why I chose this profession: to do my bit and contribute to building a better future wherever we have projects.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After 2 years of research and confidential preparation, a group of 30 pioneering European energy players officially launches "HyDeal Ambition" with the aim of delivering 100% green hydrogen across Europe at €1.5/kg before 2030.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Paris, February 11<sup>th</sup> 2021</p>



<p>The production of green hydrogen generated by solar-driven electrolysis from the Iberian Peninsula will begin in 2022. The ambition is to achieve 95 GW of solar and 67 GW of electrolysis capacity by 2030 to deliver 3.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year to users in the energy, industry and mobility sectors via the gas transmission and storage network, the energy equivalent of 1.5 months of oil consumption in France. A phased approach is anticipated with first deliveries in Spain and the Southwest of France followed by an extension towards the East of France and then Germany.</p>



<p>Industrial innovation goes beyond the simple production of truly green or climate-friendly energy. It lies in particular in the price to be delivered to customers at fossil fuel parity, making the transition to a carbon-neutral economy a self-evident perspective.</p>



<p>A series of projects and partnerships are currently being launched involving several of the 30 participants of HyDeal Ambition, with a first initiative expected within a year in Spain, based on a portfolio of solar sites with a capacity of close to 10 GW.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Inaugurated at the Lisbon Universal Exhibition in 1998, the Vasco de Gama Bridge is remarkable for several reasons. Seventeen kilometres long, it spans the Tagus estuary and for many years remained the longest bridge in Europe. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Designed and built under the leadership of Campenon Bernard SGE, a number of challenges stood in the way of the project. Since it opened, it has been durably contributing to the development of Lisbon&#8217;s southern bank, while alleviating local traffic congestion. Let’s look back at the project.</strong></p>



<h3>The clock was ticking</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="533" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama41.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview.jpeg" alt="reportage pont" class="wp-image-3737" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama41.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview.jpeg 800w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama41.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama41.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<p>When the Portuguese government issued its international call for tender, it made it clear that the bridge was to be inaugurated in time for the March 1998 Lisbon Universal Exhibition. With work starting up in January 1995, the deadline proved very tight, particularly in view of the project’s technical complexity. And yet the move paid off and the Vasco de Gama Bridge was delivered on time. A source of national pride, the engineering structure also won the award for civil engineering at the Hispano-American Architecture and Civil Engineering Biennial in Madrid in 2000.</p>



<h3>Multiple challenges</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="797" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vasco_de_gama-1024x797.jpg" alt="vasco de gama" class="wp-image-3744" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vasco_de_gama-1024x797.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vasco_de_gama-300x233.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vasco_de_gama-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vasco_de_gama.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In addition to an extremely tight construction schedule, the Vasco de Gama bridge combined a number of other challenges. Due to its unprecedented length of 17 km, the curvature of the earth had to be taken into account and appropriate technical and technological solutions had to be devised. In addition, the structure was designed to withstand earthquakes 4.5 times stronger than the one that razed Lisbon to the ground in 1755. Finally, the design of the bridge, with cable-stays reaching up to 824 metres, allows it to withstand wind speeds of up to 250 km/h.</p>



<h3>Resilience</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="707" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14_102__document-1-1024x707.jpg" alt="vasco de gama" class="wp-image-3747" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14_102__document-1-1024x707.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14_102__document-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14_102__document-1-768x530.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14_102__document-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>To span the 17 km of the Tagus, the bridge was segmented into five different parts: four viaducts and a cable-stayed bridge, in addition to the interchanges. Given the tight deadlines and the length of the structure, a unique staging programme and satellite coordination system was set up. Different solutions work in combination to protect the structure from seismic risks: the northern viaduct is equipped with a shock absorber system capable of absorbing the effects of displacement. As for the deck of the cable-stayed bridge, it is not fixed to its pylons, which allows it to move laterally and longitudinally. Its flexible piers were designed for long periods of vibration. As for the piers of the central viaduct, they are equipped with hydraulic couplings which allow the bridge to move when in use but block it in the event of an earthquake.</p>



<h3>An innovative approach</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="533" height="800" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama26.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview.jpeg" alt="pont vasco de gama" class="wp-image-3740" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama26.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview.jpeg 533w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xb-vinci-vascodegama26.jpg_pont_vasco_de_gama_preview-200x300.jpeg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /></figure>



<p>The bridge is also noteworthy in terms of its impact on the environment. Novel measures were taken at the time which contributed to promoting a new approach to assessing the environmental impact of the structures. Noise barriers, scour protection systems to protect the canal pier base and stormwater treatment basins were built in an effort to optimise and limit the impact of the bridge. On the southern bank, particular care was taken to conserve the Samouco salt marshes. These wetlands are a nature reserve and are vital to hundreds of species of birds, fish, crustaceans and molluscs. As part of the project, a new 400 ha reserve was created. In the spring of 1995, work was suspended for three weeks to allow for the passage of migratory birds.</p>

<h4><strong>“A perfect fit for a man with a free spirit”.</strong></h4>



<h5><strong>Q1/How is working underwater different?</strong></h5>



<p>In most of the work we do, good manual dexterity is all that is required. But a good diver is above all someone who can see underwater, because contrary to what you might think, visibility is often close to zero. It is called working in “black water”. It is important be able to control yourself in all circumstances and to follow rules, diving safety standards and instructions to the letter. Finally, working underwater also means enjoying being part of a team, since we always work in teams of at least 3 people.</p>



<h5><strong>Q2/Is there a project that stands out in your mind?</strong></h5>



<p>One of the projects of which I am most proud is the refurbishment of slipway for the <em>Société nationale de sauvetage en mer</em> (SNSM) at Pors Kamor in Ploumanach. It is one of the most beautiful places in Brittany in France, and a gorgeous diving spot. That’s where I started diving as a teenager and also where I got married. There is a public slipway where the SNSM keeps its all-weather lifeboat. This is my first large project and we did a lot of work there: demolition, lifting, reinforcement, concreting work, etc. People say that you remember your first worksite all your life, and this one has certainly left its mark on me!</p>



<h5><strong>Q3/Do you have a message for those who dream of following in your footsteps?</strong></h5>



<p>First of all, you need to be aware that commercial diving is not a hobby, but a demanding profession! It’s very physical, there are risks, and therefore it is crucial to observe the rules. You don&#8217;t get to choose your dives; your mission is to carry out an assignment and your surface-supplied diving system is only a mean of getting to your workstation. It takes a long time and you have to spend many hours at depth, in the dark and the cold, before you can be qualified for the job.</p>



<p>But it is an extraordinary, exciting and varied job, where you feel free.</p>

<h4><strong>In 3 words</strong></h4>



<h5><strong>Enjoyment</strong></h5>



<p>I enjoy assembling, taking apart, building, repairing and using a variety of tools. I also like adapting to different situations. Unplanned jobs energise me. Once the day is over, I totally forget about the complications we ran into and how tired I might feel.</p>



<h5><strong>Freedom</strong></h5>



<p>Because my assignments are so varied, I learn a lot every day, and I love getting to discover very unique places.</p>



<h5><strong>Pride</strong></h5>



<p>My greatest source of pride is that I enjoy my job. And I love talking about it even more. My wife and children like to listen to me talking about my assignments and they take a real interest in this little-known job. When you get out of the water, you are often really tired, but you get huge satisfaction out of a job well done. I am proud to be part of this small community of underwater workers.</p>



<h4><strong>Working as a team</strong></h4>



<p>According to the Labour Code, divers work in teams of three, and clear roles are assigned to each member.</p>



<p><strong>The hyperbaric operations manager</strong>. As dive supervisor, they are responsible for the overall diving operation (checking the diver’s air supply and diving conditions) and stay in constant contact with the diver working underwater.</p>



<p><strong>The diver </strong>performs specific tasks below the waterline.</p>



<p>The third crew member is <strong>the standby diver; </strong>they are at the surface and are prepared to assist the primary diver at any moment should the latter run into trouble.</p>



<p><strong>In Thomas&#8217; photo album&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="608" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/habillage_avant_mise_à_leau_st_malo.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3698" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/habillage_avant_mise_à_leau_st_malo.jpg 456w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/habillage_avant_mise_à_leau_st_malo-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<p>1/ Before each dive, I prepare my equipment and tools and don my gear. Then, the standby diver, also called diver tender, helps me get set up, and we do our pre-dive checks (we test the emergency air supply, communication system…). My helmet is secured only once we have run through the checklist and we have checked that the main air supply is functioning properly. Only then do I get into the water.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="766" height="1024" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056-766x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3701" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056-766x1024.jpg 766w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056-224x300.jpg 224w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056-768x1027.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056-1149x1536.jpg 1149w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/img_20201116_085056.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 766px) 100vw, 766px" /></figure>



<p>2/ Dive time is limited to 3 hours per day (including decompression stops), spread over one or two dives. In specific situations, where our dives are tide- and current-dependent, we limit our time underwater in order to ensure we are always working safely. This means two shorter dives, each of them being timed with the tide. However, the end of a dive does not mean the day is over! We take turns going underwater and being standby diver.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="456" height="608" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pose_défense_bouclier_la_rochelle.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3704" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pose_défense_bouclier_la_rochelle.jpg 456w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pose_défense_bouclier_la_rochelle-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px" /></figure>



<p>3/ All the work that can be done on land can also be done underwater, except operations take twice as long&#8230; like here in the port of La Rochelle, for the installation of new berthing fender panels.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="391" height="480" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sortie_de_leau_ploumanach.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3707" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sortie_de_leau_ploumanach.jpg 391w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sortie_de_leau_ploumanach-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="(max-width: 391px) 100vw, 391px" /></figure>



<p>4/ When you get out of the water, you are often really tired, but get huge satisfaction from a job well done. I am proud to be part of this small community of underwater workers.</p>



<h4><strong>Are you cut out for this job?</strong></h4>



<h5><strong>Are you adaptable?</strong></h5>



<p>Jobs are extremely varied and divers must constantly adapt, be it to the task at hand or because of a mechanical problem. Having a whole range of skills is essential.</p>



<h5><strong>Are you good at handling stress?</strong></h5>



<p>When working underwater, you need to be able to control your nerves in all circumstances and follow rules, diving safety standards and instructions to the letter. You also need to be able to take initiative and swift and efficient action in emergency situations.</p>



<h5><strong>Are you athletic and disciplined?</strong></h5>



<p>Diving is very physical, there are risks, and therefore it is crucial to observe the rules. You don&#8217;t get to choose your dives; your mission is to carry out an assignment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Genvia governance is established with a Board of Directors from Genvia partner companies, and the definition of a clear roadmap of ambitious milestones for the development and industrialization of solid oxide technologies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>PARIS, February 4, 2021</strong>—Schlumberger New Energy, the CEA and partners have announced Florence Lambert as the CEO of the Genvia clean hydrogen production technology venture, effective March 1, 2021. Florence brings more than 20 years of experience in new energy technologies and was previously CEO of CEA-LITEN in Grenoble, France.</p>



<p>“Florence has been a respected voice at the forefront of energy transition technology development for a number of years. We are delighted that she has chosen to bring her experience and passion to the leadership of Genvia. We believe that hydrogen is a critical energy carrier that will enable countries to meet their decarbonization ambitions,” said Ashok Belani, Executive Vice President Schlumberger New Energy.</p>



<p>In the next 30 years, hydrogen production could account for 20% of total energy demand, according to the Hydrogen Council. Genvia’s technology development and industrialization activities will be in step with the anticipated strong growth of the hydrogen economy. Genvia will provide innovative early solutions through strategic alliances in different industries.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Genvia brings together an extraordinary group of partners, to foster the new ecosystem needed to accelerate the development and industrialization of affordable clean hydrogen production. I am particularly delighted to have the opportunity with Genvia to create business and employment growth while making an impact on climate change,” said Florence Lambert, the newly appointed Genvia CEO.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Genvia Board of Directors will have high-level executive representation from its founding partners:</p>



<ul><li>François Jacq, Chairman and Philippe Stohr, Energy Division Director, CEA</li><li>Ashok Belani, Executive Vice President New Energy, and Olivier Peyret, Chairman of France, Schlumberger</li><li>Guy Sidos, Chairman and CEO, Vicat</li><li>Pascal Baylocq, CEO Geostock (VINCI Construction)</li><li>Stéphane Péré, CEO, AREC Occitanie</li></ul>



<p>The Genvia high-performance solid oxide electrolyzer technology, developed by CEA, is fully reversible, giving it the flexibility to switch between electrolysis and fuel cell functions. Genvia technology design will enable a 30% higher electricity conversion efficiency per kg of hydrogen produced, bringing the&nbsp;cost of producing clean hydrogen down to a level that competes aggressively with other sources of energy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Leveraging Schlumberger technology industrialization experience, the first Genvia manufacturing pilot line will be established at a Schlumberger manufacturing facility in Béziers in 2021. Genvia will also set up a Technology Centre co-located with the CEA in Grenoble, France, to accelerate the maturing of the technology through the industrialization process.  </p>



<p>Genvia will participate in a series of demonstration projects with partners in different use cases for the industrial, energy and mobility sectors. These demonstration projects will pave the way for the development of the full value chain for the utilization of hydrogen as the clean energy carrier of choice. The different demonstration projects are expected to range from 300 kW systems in 2023 to larger systems with megawatt capacities in 2024.</p>



<p>Based on the results of the pilot line and demonstration projects, investment into the building of a giga factory for the production of solid oxide electrolyzer and fuel cell stacks is expected to launch in 2025. The production ramp of the giga factory will enable Genvia to meet the gigawatt deliveries of electrolyzers and fuel cells, which the market is anticipated to demand at an accelerated pace in 2030 and beyond.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The 50:50 joint venture between Balfour Beatty and VINCI* has been awarded the HS2 lots N1 and N2 phase 2 contract (construction) on 1 April 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul><li>Construction contract following the successful completion of 2.5 years of design</li><li>Two lots valued at c. £5 billion, about €5.75 billion</li><li>More than 200 engineering structures over 90km near Birmingham</li></ul>



<p>The 50:50 joint venture between Balfour Beatty and VINCI* has been awarded the HS2 lots N1 and N2 phase&nbsp;2 contract (construction) on 1 April 2020. Lot N1 and Lot&nbsp;N2 are between the Long Itchington Wood Green tunnel to the Delta Junction / Birmingham Spur and from the Delta Junction to the West Coast Main Line tie-in respectively.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cpvinci_hs2_20200403-02-1024x610.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3171"/></figure>



<p>Phase 1 for these contracts had been awarded in July 2017 for the design of the West Midlands area. More than 500 engineers and technicians, including the joint venture’s designers, worked successfully to reach this milestone today and enable the project to switch from design to construction.</p>



<p>Spanning on approximately 90km, the delivery of Lot N1 and Lot N2 will include an impressive number of engineering structures, tunnels and earthworks: 51 viaducts and boxes totalling over 14km and 76&nbsp;overbridges, 7.5km of twin tunnel, 35 cuttings reaching over 30km, 76 culverts and other underbridges, 66 embankments reaching over 33km, 4 motorway crossings requiring box structures, and 6 interfaces with existing rail requiring both dive-under and overbridge structures. Lots N1 and N2 comprise a total of 1.8 million cubic meters of concrete and 32 million cubic meters of cut and landfill.</p>



<p>Work will start on site in summer 2020 with all the sanitary and safety rules that prevail according to the Covid-19 pandemic and would last 74 months. At the peak of activity, the project will employ 10,000 people.</p>



<p>The contract awards reflect the innovative and collaborative nature of this long-established and successful joint venture. Balfour Beatty’s in-depth knowledge and expertise of British transport is complemented with VINCI’s major project expertise, including the recently completed SEA Tours-Bordeaux high-speed line in France and rail infrastructure projects in the UK.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The accelerating development of AI opens up many opportunities for tomorrow’s construction sites. From Big Data to robots, we bring you an overview of artificial intelligence applications designed to facilitate and accelerate the construction process and make it safer. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><strong>What actually is artificial intelligence?</strong></h4>



<p>Artificial intelligence is based on the ability of a machine to analyse a situation, draw conclusions from it and act accordingly. AI technologies rely simultaneously on Big Data and dramatic increases in hardware computing power. They define algorithms based on identifying significant recurrences and integrating learning methods.<br><br>In parallel with the first public-facing applications, such as voice recognition and visual identification, every sector of industry is reconstructing and adapting AI according to meet its own specific needs and environment.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>At VINCI Construction, we see artificial intelligence as primarily benefiting our people.</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>In the VINCI Construction context, the first application of artificial intelligence could focus on the risks inherent in construction by relieving the operators of all repetitive processes and automating them.&nbsp;<em>“At VINCI Construction, we see AI as primarily benefiting our people. It doesn’t change the nature of what we do, but helps us to refocus on our core business”,</em>&nbsp;explains Djamil Yahia-Ouahmed, Head of Data &amp; AI at VINCI Construction.</p>



<h4><strong>No artificial intelligence without multiple data sources and accurate data collection</strong></h4>



<p>Data collection and organisation is a basic requirement for any AI application. But the fact remains that on construction sites, even with the more than promising advent of <a href="/en/news/bim-worksite-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Building Information Modelling</a>, data often remain scarce and/or fragmented. Djamil Yahia-Ouahmed: <em>“The most important consideration is to think about what could be done with the data we have, rather than imagining an immediately applicable artificial intelligence solution”.</em><br><br>Nevertheless AI could help builders in the near future. Examples of possible applications include:<br><br>&#8211; analysing of highly structured documents, such as <strong>calls for tender</strong>. The opportunity to identify dates, entities and specific contractual clauses would facilitate the tender preparation process</p>



<p>&#8211; recognition of tasks and the automated entry of the relevant data into the appropriate programmes to provide automated&nbsp;<strong>reporting</strong>&nbsp;as work progresses on site would save time</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>voice-activated virtual assistants</strong>&nbsp;would simplify the same reporting process, thereby ensuring more effective monitoring of production and unforeseen on-site events</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>analysis of site-related contractual documents</strong>, which would then be transcribed using an interactive knowledge graph. This innovative method of data visualisation provides interactive links between contributors, entities and specific topics. The result is the ability to identify cause-and-effect relationships that would otherwise have been buried deep in the thousands of documents generated by construction projects.<br><br>Examples like these allow us to imagine other applications of AI for construction sites, especially in terms of&nbsp;<strong>predictive technologies</strong>. Algorithms can help to predict the future trend of the construction site operating account by analysing the time lag between schedules, the stage of progress and the impact on overall progress of incidents and complaints. By cross-referencing all available data, algorithms should then be able to calculate a percentage accident risk and notify site managers at the same time. Similarly,&nbsp;<strong>predictive maintenance</strong>&nbsp;could be driven by algorithms that generate machine maintenance schedules based not on intervals of weeks or months, but rather on actual usage data and on-site conditions. This would enable the transition away from something that is still programmed systematically and cyclically and towards dynamic resource allocation.</p>



<h4><strong>Targeting safety</strong></h4>



<p>It is likely that we will soon see autonomous trucks in use on earthworks projects, even if they are initially confined to closed circuits with no human presence. The lack of space on urban construction sites would prohibit their use on these projects. Nevertheless, it’s important to know that AI is now capable of calculating a route to ensure that vehicles and pedestrians never meet!<br><br>But it’s primarily in safety that artificial intelligence is already showing promising advances and achievements. Video-based ‘guardian angel’ systems will be able to use image recognition to come to the assistance of someone working on scaffolding under potentially unsafe conditions. It can also detect whether someone is wearing personal protective equipment or not, and therefore &#8211; for example &#8211; prevent anyone not wearing a dosimeter from entering a nuclear industry worksite.</p>



<h4><strong>Maintaining control of your data as you step into the future</strong></h4>



<p>Tech giants, AI specialists and startups offering practical applications for the construction sector; this market is attracting more entrants all the time, each of which may play its own role in supporting VINCI Construction and its subsidiary companies to meet their artificial intelligence needs.<br><br>With support from&nbsp;<a href="https://leonard.vinci.com/">Leonard</a>, the laboratory set up to explore the future of the VINCI Group, and IT departments staffed increasingly by data scientists, AI architects and other newly emerging specialists, AI is assuming its rightful place as another valuable construction industry tool.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Building on bare ground, excavating, anchoring, containing, terracing or developing a site from the ground up: all these interactions with the natural ground and soil require the intervention of geotechnics. As essential as it is invisible, this set of construction techniques comes into play at the beginning of every construction project. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><strong>Every construction operation at ground level has its own geotechnical application</strong></h4>



<p>The range of techniques available for making soils suitable for construction projects includes:</p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>retention walling</strong>&nbsp;that enables deep vertical&nbsp;<strong>excavation</strong>&nbsp;using techniques such as&nbsp;<strong>diaphragm walling</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>sheet piling</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>deep foundations</strong>&nbsp;that transfer the weight of buildings and structures to the ground using&nbsp;<strong>piles</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>bars</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>anchoring rods</strong>&nbsp;that nail structures into the ground and stabilise excavations by anchoring into stronger ground</p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>injection</strong>&nbsp;of a reinforcement product through a borehole. When solidified, this product will consolidate and secure the soil, as well as filling cavities within it</p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>sealing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>pumping</strong>&nbsp;techniques used to control groundwater levels</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>freezing</strong>, which solidifies the ground with temperatures below zero</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>soil-mixing</strong>, which strengthens the natural soil by mixing it with a grout</p>



<p>&#8211; the&nbsp;<strong>soil improvement and reinforcement</strong>&nbsp;techniques that involve modifying soil characteristics using&nbsp;<strong>vibration</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;inclusion</strong></p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>tunnel</strong>&nbsp;construction, which uses a variety of excavation and lining techniques</p>



<p>&#8211; and&nbsp;<strong>earthworks</strong>, which involve excavating, relocating and re-characterising soil to form embankments and other earthworks structures</p>



<h4><strong>Geotechnics&#8230; A buoyant market</strong></h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>&nbsp;&#8220;Space is at an increasing premium in our cities, which means that we are forced to build underground more and more often. Expertise in geotechnics then becomes essential<em>”.</em>&nbsp;Jean-Ghislain La Fonta, Executive Vice Presdient of Sixense</strong></p></blockquote>



<p><em>“The global market for geotechnical services is buoyant as trading and transport infrastructure projects, such as ports and metro systems, are multiplying”,&nbsp;</em>explains Soletanche Bachy Executive Vice President Serge Borel. Jean-Ghislain La Fonta, Executive Vice Presdient of Sixense, completes the analysis:&nbsp;<em>“This expanding market also presents many challenges, especially in urban environments.</em>&nbsp;<em>Space is at an increasing premium in our cities, which means that we are forced to build underground more and more often. Expertise in geotechnics then becomes essential”.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Minimising geotechnical risks through highly developed expertise and multiple technical skills</strong></h4>



<p>By dealing head-on with risks and transforming them into opportunities, VINCI Construction and its subsidiaries have developed expert skills across a wide spectrum of disciplines, from geotechnics for diaphragm walling to soil consolidation and tunnelling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sb_soutenement_paroi-moulee-sb-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3451" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sb_soutenement_paroi-moulee-sb-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sb_soutenement_paroi-moulee-sb-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sb_soutenement_paroi-moulee-sb-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sb_soutenement_paroi-moulee-sb-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Technique of diaphragm walling developed by Soletanche Bachy</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8211; The key technique of&nbsp;<strong>diaphragm walling</strong>&nbsp;developed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soletanche-bachy.com/">Soletanche Bachy</a>&nbsp;is now a standard construction technique. It consists of building walls beneath ground level to provide safe working conditions for ongoing excavations</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freyssinet.com/freyssinet/wfreyssinet_fr.nsf/sb/produits-et-techniques.geotechnique">Freyssinet</a>&nbsp;offers anchoring solutions for structural stabilisation and soil reinforcement, as well as solutions for underpinning using micropiles and tie beams or injection.</p>



<p>&#8211; The success of Menard has been built on its development of&nbsp;<strong>Controlled Modulus Columns</strong>&nbsp;alongside other soil improvement techniques invented in-house</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrepose.com/fr/geostock-stockage-souterrain/qui-sommes-nous/">Entrepose subsidiary Geostock</a>&nbsp;specialises in the design and operation of&nbsp;<strong>underground hydrocarbon storage facilities</strong>. The company uses two main techniques: the excavation of salt-leached caverns and the mined rock caverns, which involve excavating rock at depths of around 100 metres. The pressure exerted by groundwater then provides assured containment of the hydrocarbon stored</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-terrassement.com/">VINCI Construction Earthworks</a>&nbsp;applies its expertise chiefly to&nbsp;<strong>linear constructions</strong>, such as roads and rail tracks. One of its goals is to reuse excavated material for future construction work to avoid the need to open new quarries</p>



<p>&#8211;&nbsp;<strong>Soil analysis technologies</strong>, particularly those that use the natural vibration created by cities to determine the nature of the subsoil,are the speciality of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixense-group.com/">Sixense</a>.</p>



<h4><strong>Flagship geotechnical projects</strong></h4>



<p>Now an important driver of growth for the Group, geotechnics has led the way in a number of high-profile projects:</p>



<p>&#8211; at <a href="/en/our-solutions-and-services/oil-gas/lng-tanks-yamal-siberia-russia/">Yamal</a> in Siberia (Russia). Double-walled cryogenic tanks for liquefied natural gas storage sit on self-cooling foundations</p>



<p>&#8211; in Kuala Lumpur (Indonesia), with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.soletanche-bachy.com/SBF/referencesb.nsf/2e325d3e230f44dcc1256a630045a04e/b4449ff6a9ebd53fc1256ae000364904!OpenDocument">Petronas Towers</a>, whose foundations &#8211; the deepest in the world &#8211; were constructed by Soletanche Bachy</p>



<p>&#8211; in Dubai, for the construction of the future Creek Tower, which will be the highest in the world when completed</p>



<p>&#8211; near Paris, during works to transfer the load from the <a href="/en/our-solutions-and-services/transport-infrastructure/cnit-station-la-defense-france/">foundations of the CNIT in La Défense</a> to hydraulic jacks as part of the project to excavate the huge underground Eole rail station for operator SNCF</p>



<p>&#8211; in Sweden, for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/fr/realisations/tunnels-ferroviaires-hallandsas/">Hallandsås</a>&nbsp;tunnel, which provides an outstanding illustration of the tunnel boring machine design expertise of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/fr/">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>. The Group is also able to rely on the expertise of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csmbessac.com/fr/">Bessac</a>, a world leader in the field of mid-size and micro-tunnel boring machines.</p>



<h4><strong>International and R&amp;D: geotechnics is driving two major growth areas</strong></h4>



<p>In every one of their operating locations, Group companies are innovating and adapting to build the structures envisioned by architects and planners.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“VINCI Construction has the densest concentration of geotechnical skills in the industry”</em>, says Jérôme Stubler, Chairman of VINCI </strong></p></blockquote>



<p>Construction.&nbsp;<em>“Clearly, we have a strong presence in the basic geotechnical markets with brands like Soletanche Bachy</em>,<a href="https://www.menard-group.com/"><em>&nbsp;Menard</em></a><em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</em><a href="http://www.botte-fondations.fr/"><em>Botte Foundations</em></a><em>, as well as in other disciplines where geotechnical engineering plays a central role, such as earthmoving and excavation”.</em></p>



<p><em>“</em>VINCI Construction has the densest concentration of geotechnical skills in the industry.<em>”</em>Jérôme Stubler, Chairman of VINCI Construction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why not leave these high-risk operations to subcontractors? Jérôme Stubler explains the choice made by the Group:<em>&nbsp;“It’s true that geotechnics does pose risks, but it also offers an opportunity when you have a good understanding of the field, but that itself requires enormous humility, because that understanding is based on parameters derived from highly fragmented knowledge. Our choice not to involve subcontractors has boosted the growth of the Group and extended our competence. Going forward, we will further expand this competence through international development and R&amp;D to gain a more detailed understanding of soil structure, so that we can navigate it more effectively in terms of guiding the construction machinery resources we use”.</em></p>

<p>For the 2017/2018 event, 1,258 students from 350 universities and graduate schools around the world responded enthusiastically to the challenge posed by VINCI Construction. The 419 projects submitted responded to the following question with real talent and relevant imagination: “<strong>How should companies working in the construction sector make use of new technologies, and how can they develop and adapt to meet society&#8217;s needs and improve people&#8217;s quality of life?</strong>”</p>



<p>In 2019/2020, the second ‘The Trail by VINCI Construction’ is once again inviting students from partner educational institutions in three disciplines that embody the challenges posed by today’s fast-changing world:</p>



<ul><li>The construction site and methods of the future</li><li>Sustainable construction and resilience</li><li>The city above and beneath the city</li></ul>



<p>In addition to promoting initiatives directly related to the issues of the future, the challenge is designed to strengthen our ties with partner educational institutions and recruit their most talented graduates. “<em>The Trail is all about demonstrating that VINCI Construction can co-construct tomorrow’s world with the talented people of tomorrow. I hope that many of them will join us</em>”, says Jérôme Stubler, Chairman of VINCI Construction.</p>



<h4><strong>A challenge to respond to the issues raised by a fast-changing world</strong></h4>



<p>The construction professionals of the future must deal effectively with many issues, including responding to exponential demographic and urban growth, increasing demand for mobility, and the need to build a sustainable world against a background of undeniable global warming&#8230;</p>



<p>The construction and infrastructure industries are absolutely on the front line when it comes to sustainable development. Between them, they consume more than 40% of the world&#8217;s energy, and generate more than a third of all greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries.</p>



<p>It is vital that the tide of&nbsp;<strong>new technologies</strong>&nbsp;flows through construction sites to help our new generations successfully meet these challenges. Future graduates will refine the use of&nbsp;<strong>digital models</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="/en/news/bim-worksite-safety/">BIM&nbsp;</a>&#8211; Building Information Modelling) and the opportunities offered by the&nbsp;<strong>digitalisation of</strong>&nbsp;<strong>project and construction design</strong>. The computing power offered by&nbsp;<strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, the introduction of&nbsp;<strong>robotisation</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="/en/news/augmented-reality-improve-construction/">augmented reality</a>&nbsp;into construction, and the ability to&nbsp;<a href="/en/news/3d-printed-concrete-impression-future/">3D-print</a>&nbsp;building materials are all contributing to the creation of a new world.</p>



<h4><strong>The Trail challenge registration and timetable</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Phase 1</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Register now at:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agorize.com/fr/challenges/thetrail2020">The Trail by VINCI Construction 2020</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Mid-March 2020: meeting the finalists from each country at the national award ceremony. The teams selected at this stage will then receive support in developing their projects from VINCI Construction sponsors.</p>



<p><strong>Phase 3</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; On 28 and 29 May 2020, the semi-finalists will pitch their projects at Leonard, the VINCI Group outlook and innovation platform, and compete in a sporting challenge.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The 3D printing of concrete makes it possible to build complex composite shapes, facilitates bespoke design, and holds out the promise of a smaller ecological footprint for the construction industry. 2019 sees a dramatic increase in the initiatives and achievements of VINCI Construction in France and around the world. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>3D printed concrete: robots, engineers and architects</h4>



<p>Since they were first developed in the early 2000s, 3D printers and the technique of additive printing have been rapidly taken up by manufacturers of automotive components, jewellery and medical prostheses. The technique works with many different types of material, from plastics to wax, metal and plaster. The ability to quickly produce small runs of products in innovative shapes is also injecting new inspiration into the construction industry, despite the fact that it must nevertheless overcome an additional challenge that relates directly to its preferred construction material&#8230; concrete.</p>



<p>Extruded through the print head of a 3D printing robot, the concrete is deposited progressively in a series of successive layers, entirely removing any need for formwork or moulds. The printed layer must consolidate quickly enough to prevent it collapsing during the printing process, and yet remain fresh enough for each successive layer to adhere to the previous one.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3549" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/romaric_quentin-2-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“This layered printing process gives engineers the opportunity to use form to benefit performance, and gives architects enormous three-dimensional design freedom.”</em>, says Romaric Quentin, R&amp;D and Innovation Engineer at VINCI Construction.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h4>Using 3D concrete printing to build in a more resource-efficient world</h4>



<p>In the three years from 2011 to 2013, China consumed as much cement as the USA did during the entire 20th century, according to figures from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Making-the-Modern-World" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gatesnotes, USGS</a>). And worldwide, demand is soaring exponentially: OECD forecasts suggest that Africa is likely to build 90 billion square metres of new floor space by 2060, and China 230 billion. The use of concrete is also resulting in a worrying shortage of sand.</p>



<p>Minimising the use of construction materials, and therefore raw materials, building without the use of lost formwork, avoiding the need for transport by printing components as close as possible to construction sites (or even on site), cutting worksite noise pollution and reducing health and safety risks: 3D concrete printing could achieve all these aims, at the same time as contributing to the research and development effort to develop more sustainable technologies.</p>



<p>The modular forms that can be created using digital technology and the additive printing process provide encouragement to reconsider the very design of our buildings. A new-generation wall could incorporate insulation into a honeycomb structure to minimise the use of both cement and insulation. Similarly, it opens up new possibilities in the design phase, such as the use of topological optimisation algorithms to improve the mechanical performance of tomorrow&#8217;s structures.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the technique is not suitable for every application:&nbsp;<em>“For the time being, this remains a niche market”,&nbsp;</em>explains Chloé Clair, Innovation and Engineering Director at VINCI Construction.&nbsp;<em>“Identifying applications for 3D concrete printing requires explicit and complex use cases”</em>.</p>



<h4>An innovation yet to be standardised and certified</h4>



<p>Although 3D concrete printing is a promising technique in many ways, its practical application is hampered by mechanical characteristics that have yet to be precisely determined. VINCI Construction is working with CSTB (the French Scientific and Technical Centre for Building) and CERIB (the French Centre for Concrete Industry Studies &amp; Research) to assess its performance on the basis of ongoing experiments, and to work towards standard compliance of the process and the construction components it produces.</p>



<p>A 12-metre high telecommunications mast produced using the modularity of 3D concrete printing and the well-established technical characteristics of prestressed concrete structures will soon be installed by Freyssinet on the island of Guadeloupe. This manufacturing process was chosen because of the seismic resistance of the resulting complex structure, and the unusually aesthetic integration of the structure into its environment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="636" height="900" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3d-beton-poteau-telecom-photo_freyssinet.png" alt="" class="wp-image-3540" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3d-beton-poteau-telecom-photo_freyssinet.png 636w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3d-beton-poteau-telecom-photo_freyssinet-212x300.png 212w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /><figcaption>Telecommunications mast, Guadeloupe &#8211; © Freyssinet</figcaption></figure>



<h4>VINCI Construction and its partners are at the cutting edge of 3D concrete printing R&amp;D</h4>



<p>As early as 2017, VINCI Construction acquired an equity stake in the startup&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xtreee.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XtreeE</a>, which has developed this technology to a point where it delivers an unrivalled quality of finish. A custom-made stormwater overflow in Lille and a 4-metre high pole supporting a courtyard canopy at a secondary school in Aix-en-Provence were the first flagship applications of this young French company.</p>



<p>Another startup, this time an intrapreneurial venture, has based its showroom and production facilities in Dubai (United Arab Emirates).&nbsp;<a href="https://www.concreative.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concreative</a>&nbsp;was created within Freyssinet and is working closely with with XtreeE to respond to an unprecedented challenge issued by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Emir of Dubai: to 3D concrete print 25% of the country’s buildings by 2030. A joint venture between Freyssinet Golfe and local industry stakeholders has just opened a fully automated 700 m² production plant to manufacture construction components.</p>



<p>VINCI Construction and XtreeE launched their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.agorize.com/en/challenges/3dcp-challenge?lang=fr" target="_blank">3DCP Challenge</a> to raise awareness among engineering, architecture and design students of the promising future of 3D concrete printing. The winners were the Franco-Canadian team of Victor de Bono and Aurélien Catros, whose design <em>Archelon</em> is a biomimetic structure inspired by a 60-metre long, 8-metre high turtle shell to cover the tracks and platforms of an overground metro station. The winners now have the opportunity to be inspired by a period of working with Concreative in Dubai. The other finalists will continue to be supported and challenged by VINCI Construction and its subsidiaries.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Universally praised for its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon, timber is making a strong comeback. Working through its subsidiary company Arbonis, VINCI Construction France is responding to the strong growth in demand for high-rise buildings by introducing innovative timber-based solutions. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4>Timber as a response to the challenges of the energy transition</h4>



<p>Used for centuries in stud walling and timber frames, wood is now finding new roles beyond its traditional uses, and attracting the attention of building owners and investors interested in its reduced environmental footprint. Entirely renewable and recyclable, wood is a material with a positive carbon footprint, and requires relatively little energy to process. Naturally insulating and a poor conductor of heat, it guarantees a high level of thermal insulation.</p>



<p>VINCI Construction France subsidiary company&nbsp;<a href="http://www.arbonis.com/?lang=en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbonis</a>&nbsp;is a pioneer in timber construction, and an acknowledged leader in construction applications for these biosourced materials.</p>



<h4>Timber high-rise residential buildings are becoming increasingly common</h4>



<p>Timber construction has traditionally accounted for only 3% to 4% of all apartment buildings, and has been used mainly for buildings up to 4 storeys high. Now though, there are an increasing number of projects underway for buildings with between 7 and 16 storeys that use timber either for the shell of the building or its structure. Previous flagship Arbonis projects include the (8-storey) Woodwork building in Saint-Denis, and one of the highest timber-framed tower blocks in France (12-storey) the Treed It development in Champs-sur-Marne.</p>



<p>Arbonis offers fully-engineered solutions from its in-house design office to provide innovative and relevant industrial solutions to the acoustic, fire and earthquake resistance challenges that high-rise buildings must overcome.</p>



<p>Aqualagon des Villages Nature® Paris is an excellent example of how&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction France</a>&nbsp;relies on its timber construction expertise in combination with concrete and steel, using each material within its individual optimum performance envelope.</p>



<h4>Arbonis wins a 2018 National Timber Construction Award</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arbonis-residence-aix-marseille-photo-benoit_wehrle-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3484" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arbonis-residence-aix-marseille-photo-benoit_wehrle-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arbonis-residence-aix-marseille-photo-benoit_wehrle-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arbonis-residence-aix-marseille-photo-benoit_wehrle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arbonis-residence-aix-marseille-photo-benoit_wehrle.jpg 1387w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>CROUS Aix-Marseille University student residence (Marseille, France) &#8211; © Benoit WEHRLE</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built by Travaux du Midi and Arbonis, the Lucien Cornil student residence in Marseille is one of the tallest timber buildings in France, at 22 metres high. Joint winner in the ‘Living Together’ category of the National Timber Construction Awards, its structure uses 33 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of spruce glulam, and the building contains more than 6,600 m² of laminated timber panels. Workshop prefabrication of the timber-framed walls made it possible to deliver all eight levels within a short lead time and with no inconvenience to residents.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In partnership with other construction industry stakeholders, VINCI Construction has set up a new company called DISCERN to roll out the widespread use of augmented reality on construction sites. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An R&amp;D project led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dodincampenonbernard.fr/2018-memento/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dodin Campenon Bernard</a>&nbsp;recently highlighted the importance of augmented reality on construction sites. Its ability to make the invisible visible makes it an extension of the&nbsp;<strong>digital model</strong>&nbsp;by enabling superimposition of a digital drawing onto the actual construction at a given point in time to make it easier to understand and check where particular facilities are to be installed or integrated.</p>



<p>To achieve this, VINCI Construction has joined forces with Chantiers de l&#8217;Atlantique, Clarte and Arnaud Cosson to set up&nbsp;<a href="http://discern-solution.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DISCERN</a>&nbsp;in February this year. Based in Laval, the new company markets augmented reality software that facilitates assembly compliance checking, for example. The operator uses a tablet or smart glasses to view the retrieved digital drawing of the installation under construction, and superimpose it on the real-life situation to check that service ducts and routes are consistent with the drawing and have been correctly assembled.</p>



<p>“This new tool is designed to eliminate the familiar digital divide between the design office and the construction site”, summarises DISCERN Chairman Arnaud Cosson. “In building construction, corrective coring, for example, can impose enormous additional costs”. This operation involves boring new holes in concrete walls to allow services to pass through following a ducting location error.</p>



<p>Initially used to improve installation conformity, augmented reality software can also be used to improve the traceability of operations, assembly, maintenance or operation of connected installations.</p>



<h4>Time saving and optimum efficiency: augmented reality at Roland-Garros</h4>



<p>Augmented reality is already in action on some projects. The construction design work for the project to upgrade the Philippe-Chatrier tennis court at the Roland-Garros Stadium was carried out using a&nbsp;<strong>BIM</strong>&nbsp;system. The service networks (heating, water, etc.) were installed using smart glasses to superimpose the actual situation onto the digital model. Used in this instance by VINCI Construction France subsidiary&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.petit-construction.fr/" target="_blank">PETIT</a>, augmented reality made it possible to converge the virtual and real worlds; a technique that was applied as part of checking underground service networks.</p>

<h4>Legendary bridges in excellent condition</h4>



<p>After the collapse of the Genoa motorway bridge in the summer of 2018, the French Ministry of Transport published the results of a national survey conducted to establish the condition of road bridges in France. Two one-of-a-kind structures were found to be in excellent condition: the Millau viaduct and the Normandy bridge. The latter, built by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freyssinet.com/freyssinet/wfreyssinet_en.nsf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freyssinet&nbsp;</a>in the early 1990s, was then the world&#8217;s largest cable-stayed bridge, with a central span of 856 metres.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.freyssinet.fr/freyssinet/wfreyssinet_fr.nsf/0/9023C584166E462AC1257C5800534664/$file/FR_Normandie_FR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Normandy bridge</a>&nbsp;is the first example of a series of challenges successfully achieved by VINCI Construction and its subsidiaries. Michel Virlogeux, one of the greatest architects of cable-stayed bridges, recalls the technical difficulties that Freyssinet had to overcome when building his curving cable-stayed bridge at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrq1rNIWi9g&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Térénez</a>.</p>



<h4>Cable-stayed bridges: linking geographies</h4>

<h4>Each cable-stayed bridge has its own challenges</h4>



<p>A cable-stayed bridge is distinctive for the high level of flexibility in the deck that forms its superstructure. Because it allows optimal use of the stays, this flexibility poses challenges to bridge builders that can be resolved only using the most advanced computer calculation methods. For example, the casting of segment 21 of the central span of the Atlantic Bridge imposed a new load of 250 tonnes at a distance of 170 metres from the pylon. At the time of casting on the basis of previous computer models, segment 20 of the central span had descended 75 cm, and the pylon had moved 38 cm longitudinally to the same side. But the use of sophisticated computer calculation systems made it possible to integrate the movements of the structure throughout the construction process, which meant that the decks laid from opposite banks met perfectly at the centre point of the 530-metre central span. This process of connecting the two deck sections by casting the keystone segment in-situ required the use of substantial temporary structures capable of supporting 2,000 tonnes in order to retain the deck sections longitudinally. Nevertheless, the extreme accuracy of the geometric checks carried out on the bridge and the flexibility of its deck made it possible to use only relatively limited resources to achieve perfect alignment of the deck sections vertically and horizontally.</p>



<p>Every project has its own goals. To ensure maximum stability for rail traffic, the central span of the&nbsp;<a href="/en/our-solutions-and-services/transport-infrastructure/yavuz-sultan-selim-bridge-istanbul-turkey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yavuz Sultan Selim</a>&nbsp;bridge in Istanbul adds the advantages of a cable-stayed bridge to those of a suspension bridge. The cables and dampers for this structure were designed, supplied and installed by Freyssinet. On the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.vinci.com/vinci.nsf/en/news-update/pages/freyssinet_cables_for_the_new_kosciuszko_bridge_in_new_york_united_states_of_america_062017.htm" target="_blank">Kosciuszko Bridge</a>&nbsp;that links Queens to Brooklyn in New York City, the stays are fitted with innovative fire and explosion protection systems recently designed and introduced by Freyssinet.</p>



<p>Over the last two years,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sixense-group.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sixense&nbsp;</a>has monitored eight cable-stayed bridges around the world: from Vietnam (Cao Lanh Bridge) to Kentucky (ORB), Russia (Korabelny &amp; Petrovsky) and Turkey (Bosphorus 3).</p>



<p>From design to maintenance, cable-stayed bridges are assured of their full lifespan now and going forward thanks to state-of-the-art technologies developed by VINCI Construction and its subsidiaries. Powerful geographic icons, cable-stayed bridges will continue to link riverbanks, regions and continents for a very long time.</p>

<p>Delivered last April, this third phase of work also includes the refurbishment of the six new courts around Court 14 (formerly Court 18 in the 2018 tournament) in the Fonds des Princes section of the complex.</p>



<p>The 5,000-seater Simonne-Mathieu Court in the Auteuil greenhouse garden was delivered in 2018 and officially opened in March this year.</p>



<p>Begun in 2016, work on upgrading the stadium will be completed in 2021, and includes covering the Philippe-Chatrier Court with a retractable roof for delivery in 2020. This moving roof will be formed from eleven giant beams shaped like an aircraft wing in recognition of the role played by Roland-Garros as a pioneer of aviation. The metal frame of each wing will be covered with a waterproof technical fabric, and the finished roof will be able to operate in winds of up to 60 kph. Complete covering of the court will take around 15 minutes.</p>



<p>The enlarged and upgraded stadium will have a capacity of 45,000 spectators per day, and is designed to remain competitive by offering better conditions for players, spectators, the media and partners.</p>



<p>The lead contractors for the project are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction France</a>&nbsp;subsidiary companies&nbsp;<a href="http://www.petit-construction.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Petit&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.chantiers-modernes.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chantiers Modernes Construction</a>.</p>



<p>The entire facility is targeting a BREEAM Tailored Criteria Development certification ‘Very Good’ rating.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Digital modelling, an area for improvement on worksites, enables risks to be identified and managed as well as raising awareness of employees and, as a result, provide them with a safe working environment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><strong>BIM enables risks to be better id</strong><strong>entified&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><strong>External risks</strong>&nbsp;result from the worksite environment and, in particular, access points. They are linked to the flow of vehicles and pedestrians, parking, access points and storage areas, etc.</p>



<p><strong>Risks</strong>&nbsp;<strong>on worksites</strong>&nbsp;increase considerably during their preparation and while equipment is being installed. Afterwards, accessing workplaces, the flow of vehicles and pedestrians, different tradesmen working at the same time, etc, must be orchestrated. Being able to view them upstream makes prevention easier.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><em>“The 3D worksite installation plan […] is rich in information both in terms of making it easier to get an overview of all the players involved in the life of a worksite as well as pinpointing any potential threats to safety with regard to vehicle and pedestrian flow both on the worksite and in the immediate vicinity,</em>” confirms Romain Hacquard from the VINCI Construction France Normandie-Centre Digital Development Division.</strong></p></blockquote>



<h4><strong>Enhanced risk management thanks to BIM</strong></h4>



<p>The overall and collaborative vision provided by BIM makes it possible to manage site risks as work progresses starting before work begins and not while it is being conducted. This development represents a major development as it changes almost everything.</p>



<h4><strong>A priority from the design phase onwards</strong></h4>



<p>Including BIM in the construction process makes it possible to anticipate situations presenting the greatest possible risks such as working at a great height and contexts involving significant slopes. On the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction.fr/actualites/pose-premiere-pierre-du-parc-aqualudique-bergerac">Parc aqualudique de Bergerac</a>&nbsp;worksite, digital modelling was used by Thomas Mohen, VINCI Construction France Nouvelle Aquitaine Division, from the earthwork phase onwards in order to identify peripheral safety protection points and extract section drawings showing slopes, staircases, etc.</p>



<h4><strong>More free-flowing worksite organisation</strong></h4>



<p>The correct positioning of a crane, secure access needs, delivery flows and storage requirements can all be based on digital readings and their 3D representations. Within teams, BIM plays an educational role: “<em>It brings together process planning teams and works teams</em>,” says Adrien Reversat, VINCI Construction France Process Planning in the Centre-Est – Campenon Bernard Nucléaire Division.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="801" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france-1024x801.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3642" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france-1024x801.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france-300x235.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france-768x601.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france-1536x1202.jpg 1536w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/simulation_digitale-vinci_construction_france.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Digital simulation of a worksite designed to calibrate the process planning of each phase – © VINCI Construction France</figcaption></figure>



<p>The complex and restrictive urban environment of numerous projects is better understood thanks to the addition of the benefits of&nbsp;<strong>virtual</strong>&nbsp;<strong>reality</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>worksite environment viewing using drones</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>satellite views</strong>.</p>



<p>As worksites are by definition constantly evolving environments, digital modelling helps plan the developments of the areas that need to be made safe. Having a clean and well organised worksite represents a safety factor for all players both for workers involved in building the shell or other tradesmen who work onsite at specific moments in time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>BIM not only retraces the model at any given moment in time, it also factors in work schedules consequently creating a&nbsp;<strong>4D model</strong>. Similarly, the&nbsp;<strong>geolocation</strong>&nbsp;of plant and men transforms the digital tool into a virtual safety pilot operating at all times.</p>



<h4><strong>Safety in the workplace</strong></h4>



<p>Shell worksite managers can analyse and explain workplace access points and working procedures by using digital models. All stakeholders are now able to focus, in particular, on unfamiliar procedures and special materials which can be a source of risks.</p>



<p><strong>3D viewing</strong>&nbsp;of works facilitates the process of choosing the best materials and ensuring the safety of tradesmen in their working environment. «&nbsp;<em>Before, we were faced with a problem during worksite operations whereas today we can simulate it from every angle before we begin building,”&nbsp;</em>explains Raphaël Avenier, VINCI Construction France-Provence Division.</p>



<p>BIM provides the possibility of obtaining the nomenclature of parts quickly, checking their weight and simulating the assembly. The level of safety is increased with each step.</p>



<h4><strong>Dedicated materials</strong></h4>



<p>Being able to have an overview of all the safety factors in the digital model ensures that the right materials have been chosen in the right places, with good support, level by level. We were able to develop special tools upstream that ensured our personnel could work in complete safety on the walls of the <a href="/en/news/la-marseillaise-tower-a-project-that-sets-the-standard-for-the-new-waterfront-of-marseille/">Tour La Marseillaise</a>. “<em>Digital modelling allowed us to design workers’ walkways enabling our personnel to work at a height of 150 metres,</em>” says Raphaël Avenier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="893" height="1024" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tour_la_marseillaise-michèle_clavel-893x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3646" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tour_la_marseillaise-michèle_clavel-893x1024.jpg 893w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tour_la_marseillaise-michèle_clavel-262x300.jpg 262w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tour_la_marseillaise-michèle_clavel-768x881.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/tour_la_marseillaise-michèle_clavel.jpg 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" /><figcaption>High-performance device designed to position fibre-reinforced concrete walls, Tower La Marseillaise &#8211; © Michèle CLAVEL</figcaption></figure>



<h4><strong>Additional applications for communicating with BIM</strong></h4>



<p>Thanks to digital modelling, worksites can be viewed upstream with the possibility of using each detail. Numerous additional applications help explain risks more efficiently and enhance communication with the various worksite stakeholders and residents. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With regard to residents, 3D viewing – sometimes animated – of the temporary organisation system for the neighbourhood’s access routes and signage modelling makes it possible for everyone to acknowledge decision-making accuracy.</p>



<p>As for the players involved on the worksite, BIM can be used by team managers and tradesmen in a “<strong>BIM booth</strong>” – the <strong>digital totem</strong> found on VINCI Construction worksites – and is used, for example, as a focal point during the “15 minute-safety sessions” at the beginning of the day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="740" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-1024x740.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3649" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-1024x740.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-768x555.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-1536x1109.jpg 1536w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/realite_virtuelle-vinci_construction_france-2048x1479.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Virtual reality harnessed to view the risks of men/plant collisions, used here by the Provence Division &#8211; © VINCI Construction France</figcaption></figure>



<p>Virtual reality, with its futuristic headsets, can further enhance this key moment for safety, thanks to serious games that model accidents and enable users to experience actual circumstances.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Using BIM for training</strong></h4>



<p>BIM and its&nbsp;<strong>virtual reality</strong>&nbsp;applications are excellent training materials as this technology enables users to make mistakes without any consequences, something that is, of course, impossible in reality. Learning by making mistakes and through experience enables trainees to adopt a “checking culture”. Seeing your environment prior to actually working in it represents a major gain in terms of risk prevention and worksite efficiency.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Custom project implementation at a site with multiple constraints]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister of Environment of the Brussels-Capital Region, Céline Fremault, has opened the Brussels South wastewater treatment plant today. The plant includes Europe’s second-largest ultrafiltration membrane surface, put into service by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>. This project, which has thus concluded a second major upgrading phase, is carried out by a consortium consisting of VINCI Construction Grands Projets, CFE, and Nizet Entreprise on behalf of the city’s water-management authority, Société Bruxelloise de Gestion de l’Eau.</p>



<p>From now on, a quarter of the wastewater produced in Brussels Region, which is equivalent to the volume consumed by 360,000 residents, will be treated using a high-performance process that can filter bacteriological waste and re-use water in sprinkling and irrigation systems.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="678" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1-1024x678.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2545" title="The Brussels South wastewater treatment plant - © EJF Riche" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step_bruxelles-sud-contenu-ejf_riche-1.jpg 1630w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><br>The Brussels South wastewater treatment plant &#8211; © EJF Riche</figcaption></figure>



<p>This new ultrafiltration system, implemented by VINCI Construction Grands Projets, comes into play in the final stage of treated water and sludge separation thanks to the deployment of a 226,000-square-metre filtration surface. The process is preceded by advanced primary treatment stages (implemented during the first upgrading phase) using fine-screening settings of 6 millimetres and 1 millimetre and lamellar settling. It provides biological treatment of water to eliminate nitrogen and phosphorus in mixing and aeration basins 30,000 cubic metres in volume and 15 metres in depth. In rainy weather conditions, primary treatment can handle up to 5 cubic metres per second, with ultrafiltration membrane capacity approaching 2 cubic metres per second.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step-bruxelles_sud-membranes-contenu-ejf_riche-1-1024x925.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2548" width="580" height="523" title="The Brussels South wastewater treatment plant - © EJF Riche" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step-bruxelles_sud-membranes-contenu-ejf_riche-1-1024x925.jpg 1024w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step-bruxelles_sud-membranes-contenu-ejf_riche-1-300x271.jpg 300w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step-bruxelles_sud-membranes-contenu-ejf_riche-1-768x694.jpg 768w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/step-bruxelles_sud-membranes-contenu-ejf_riche-1.jpg 1078w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><figcaption>Installation of the membranes of the Brussels South wastewater treatment plant &#8211; © EJF Riche</figcaption></figure>



<p>This technology, which combines peak performance (currently a pinnacle in the wastewater treatment sector) and compactness (226,000 square metres of membranes installed on a 1,500-square-metre surface), provides considerable benefits to projects with severe space constraints. That is the case at the Brussels South wastewater treatment plant, whose current site is cramped and packed with multiple structures in a busy urban setting.</p>



<p>Yet another constraint is having to maintain operations at the plant during the entire duration of the project in accordance with a highly precise and demanding task-sequencing schedule. Upon entry into service, each new project phase is operated by the consortium, with VINCI Construction Grands Projets providing close monitoring of the process’s development. This overview phase for the new ultrafiltration complex will last two years.</p>



<p>A new and final project stage will be launched in early 2019 with the construction of digestion (or methanisation) structures to handle sludge resulting from water treatment and of structures dedicated to the re-use of produced biogas for heat and electrical power generation as a means of limiting the new Brussels South wastewater treatment plant’s environmental impact.</p>



<p>Brussels South is the tenth membrane-treatment project implemented by VINCI Construction Grands Projets. Its scope and complexity, however, pave the way for new developments in other large cities striving to preserve resources and their reception environments.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The contract covers 5.3 km viaducts over the sea and new tunnels, as well as the widening of 14.5 km of existing roads]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Governor of the State of Virginia in the United States has announced it has selected the joint venture comprising&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/fr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VINCI Construction Grands Projets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dodincampenonbernard.fr/accueil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dodin Campenon Bernard</a>, both VINCI Construction subsidiaries (33%), Dragados USA (42%) and Flatiron (25%), for the contract of extending and upgrading the I-64 between Hampton and Norfolk, worth €2.9 billion ($3.3 billion). The contract is expected to be executed in April 2019 with construction expected to conclude in 2025.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="583" height="539" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/i-64-etats-unis-map-contenu-vdot.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-2588" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/i-64-etats-unis-map-contenu-vdot.jpg 583w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/i-64-etats-unis-map-contenu-vdot-300x277.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /><figcaption>Design-Build Project Plan for the I-64 Hampton-Norfolk Road Link in Virginia &#8211; © VDOT</figcaption></figure>



<p>The project calls for designing and building 5.3 km of viaducts over the sea and new tunnels, as well as widening 14.5 km of existing roads.</p>



<p>The new component involves digging two tunnels, each 2.4 km long, between two artificial islands using a variable density tunnel boring machine with a diameter of 13.56 metres. The two islands will be connected to the continent by two viaducts over the sea, the first measuring 1 km and the other 1.9 km. For the existing component, demolition, reconstruction and widening works will be carried out over 14.5 km of road and two additional traffic lanes will be created in each direction. The road will continue to be used throughout the works.</p>



<p>The project’s aim is to decongest the existing network: the existing road, which dates back to 1976, is used daily by over 100,000 vehicles, causing tailbacks of up to 8 km to the bridge upstream.</p>



<p>VINCI is a recognised player in the modernisation and extension of the US road network. In December 2016, for instance, VINCI Construction Grands Projets delivered the&nbsp;<a href="https://vicprdwcomfbe01.vc-ic.grpsc.net/en/expertises/lewis-and-clark-bridge-east-end-crossing-louisville-kentucky-united-states/222/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ohio River Bridge</a>&nbsp;between Indiana and Kentucky, which included a 762 metre cable stayed bridge, a 512 metre twin-bore tunnel and 19 engineering structures. The Ohio River Bridge project was the VINCI Group’s first public-private partnership in the United States.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[VINCI Construction France has completed work on La Marseillaise, the first office tower of the Quais d’Arenc project in Marseille. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new feature of the Marseille city skyline and its waterfront, La Marseillaise &#8211; funded by property developer Constructa and designed by architect Jean Nouvel &#8211; marks the second phase of the major project to regenerate the Quais d’Arenc. At 135 metres height, La Marseillaise offers 35,000 m² of office space on 31 floors. It also boasts a shared company restaurant, a 26-place crèche and five ground floor retail units.</p>



<p>With completion of the La Marseillaise tower, VINCI Construction France – working through its local subsidiaries GTM Sud and Travaux du Midi &#8211; confirms its expertise in tower construction and major projects that deliver cutting-edge technical performance in dense urban surroundings. This technical feat has been achieved within what is a very restricted site environment. Constructed at the edge of the sea on exceptionally rocky land, exposed to sea winds and bounded by a rail line and an urban motorway, La Marseillaise is both a technical and innovative achievement. &nbsp;</p>



<h2>An exemplary project site both environmentally and socially</h2>



<p>The project site fully respected the ten criteria set by the VINCI Construction France ‘Attitude Environnement’ eco-commitment label for responsible construction. This means that special attention was paid to the processing of waste, as well as water and electricity usage. For example, the teams were uncompromising in their monitoring of selective waste sorting; a commitment that allowed them to reclaim and recycle 96% of waste, rather than the required rate of 80%. In terms of energy performance, the project complies fully with the 2012 thermal insulation regulations updated by 10%, and by targeting NF HQE® Level Excellent and LEED® Gold certification, this tower achieves the highest standards applicable today. The construction work also set an ambitious target for work experience recruitment, with more than 52,600 hours worked under this scheme, and a total of 42 people recruited, rather than the 8,700 hours and 29 recruitments initially planned. At the peak of the project, work on site involved more than 600 skilled tradesmen and women. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In Uganda, Sogea-Satom has completed work on a drainage pipeline network to take waste water from Kinawataka and Nakivubo, two drainage basins of the capital Kampala. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This project is designed to protect water quality in Murchison Bay on Lake Victoria, from where water is abstracted to produce drinking water for consumers in Kampala. It involved the installation of 30 km of pipelines. Of that total, 26 km are gravity feed, ranging in diameter from 200 to 1800 mm, while the remaining 4 km are cast-iron pressurised waste water pipes of 500 mm diameter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project was subject to a series of major constraints, which included the need for particularly deep trenches of up to 11.5 metres in an urban environment with a very large number of other utility networks with no as-built drawings (optical fibre, telecoms, electricity, etc.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The underground pipelines replace an open channel to avoid the obvious problems of hygiene and odour. So the city’s waste water network now feeds a pre-treatment plant (also constructed by Sogea-Satom under a separate €12 million contract), and a final effluent treatment plant from which the treated water is clean enough to be discharged into the natural environment. The result is that waste water is no longer discharged directly into Lake Victoria.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 56 months of work were completed at the end of September 2018.</p>



<p>Contract value: €44 million, including €34 million for Sogea-Satom</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Awards went to historic building restructuring and renovation projects in Paris, Rennes, Annecy and Avignon. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;annual Geste d’Or competition, which recognises exemplary projects focused on the heritage of the past, the present and the future, once again rewarded the operating excellence of VINCI Construction France. The French leader in building and civil engineering won four awards at the 2018 International Cultural Heritage Fair&nbsp;held at the Carrousel du Louvre in Paris from 24 to 28 October. Three projects carried out by VINCI Construction France and its subsidiaries were also included in the&nbsp;<strong>Grand Prix</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Cultivez, Bâtissez la même Terre</strong>&nbsp;award presented to VINCI Construction. These distinctions reflect VINCI Construction France’s expertise and know-how in the field of historic monument restoration and architectural heritage conservation.</p>



<p>The Geste d’Or competition annually recognisesprojects that set an example in sustainability, people management and balanced financial engineering.</p>



<p>The Geste d’Or focuses not only the heritage itself but also on its adaptation to the present and on future construction. The 2018 competition once again recognised VINCI Construction France’s approach to the art of building and the commitment of its teams to heritage enhancement based on careful attention to ecology, economy and ethics.</p>



<h4>Geste d’Or Grand Prix Architecture, Innovation Sociale et Économique award: restructuring of the building at 8-10 rue Charles V (Paris 4<sup>th</sup> <em>arrondissement</em>), GTM Bâtiment</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="314" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtm_batiment-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3299" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtm_batiment-2.jpg 600w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtm_batiment-2-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Located in the heart of Paris’s historic and historically preserved Marais neighbourhood, the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century building at 10, rue Charles V is a former mansion that has undergone a large number of transformations over the years. The adjacent building and annexes at 8, rue Charles V date back to 1938. The project involved demolition, reconstruction and restoration of the existing structures to create a contemporary multipurpose complex accommodating laboratories and apartments (55 units) on a single plot of land. For the project teams, the three main challenges lay in putting together large usable volumes while conserving the open spaces of the original structures (courtyard and garden); restoring the heritage elements selected for individual enhancement; and lastly new construction, all in a dense and restricted urban environment. The complex at 8-10 rue Charles V is an exceptional structure in which existing and restored materials blend perfectly with the new spaces.</p>



<h4>Geste d’Or Grand Prix Chantier award: Couvent des Jacobins monastery in Rennes, Sogea Bretagne BTP</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="314" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sogea_bretagne_btp-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3302" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sogea_bretagne_btp-2.jpg 600w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sogea_bretagne_btp-2-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The iconic Couvent des Jacobins project in the centre of Rennes was carried out to give the original monastery buildings, which date back to the 14<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century and are listed as a Historic Monument, a new lease on life. The complex now houses the 38,000 sq. metre Rennes Convention Centre and contains three concert halls, some 20 meeting rooms, an exhibition space and several restaurants. The four-year project was a technical challenge that notably included the rehabilitation of the monument by Degaine, a VINCI Construction France subsidiary. Among other things, Degaine restored the stone facings, replaced 370 cu. metres of dressed stone, applied 6,000 sq. metres of lime plaster and installed 1,900 sq. metres of terracotta flooring.</p>



<h4>Geste d’Or du Grand Prix Amont award: Soeurs de Saint-Joseph cloister in Annecy, ADIM Lyon</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="314" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/adim_lyon-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3305" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/adim_lyon-2.jpg 600w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/adim_lyon-2-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>This rehabilitation project originated in a joint deliberation by the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph, the City of Annecy, the Architecte des Bâtiments de France architectural review board and ADIM Lyon. The work carried out by VINCI Construction France subsidiary Citinéa will restructure the former convent, which was built in the centre of Annecy in the first half of the 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, into 37 apartments and two town houses, while preserving the adjacent park and opening it to the public. The exemplary rehabilitation of the historic building aims to conserve and draw attention to elements with heritage value. For example, the lime and dressed stone restoration of the facades and the renovation of the frame and tile roof will be carried out by local VINCI Construction France subsidiaries Comte and Bourgeois, which specialise in heritage and historic monument restoration.</p>



<h4>Geste d’Argent Grand Prix Métiers award: Tour des Anges and Tour de la Garde-Robe towers at the Papal Palace in Avignon, Girard</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="314" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/girard-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3308" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/girard-2.jpg 600w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/girard-2-300x157.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>Located in the heart of Avignon&#8217;s historic centre and listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Papal Palace is an iconic example of medieval architecture. The facades and battlements of the Tour des Anges and the Tour de la Garde-Robe towers, which were built in 1342, require restoration. The teams from Girard, responsible for the &#8220;masonry &#8211; dressed stone&#8221; and &#8220;sculpture&#8221; works packages, cleaned the cladding and replaced more than 135 sq. metres of stones. The highly technical operation called for the full range of their expertise and meticulous know-how: cutting the stone to order in the workshop, installing it by chain hoist, sliding it into place on white wood wedges, repointing with lime and applying a patina made of water, hydrated lime and natural ochre to harmonise it with the original stones. The second challenge was replacement of all existing gargoyles with eight new ones. Each new gargoyle, weighing 800 kg, was drawn, sculpted and installed by workers at the top of the Tour des Anges.</p>



<h4>Grand Prix Cultivez, Bâtissez la même Terre award</h4>



<p>This award, presented for the first time, went to three VINCI Construction France projects.</p>



<ul><li>Urbalia2 was recognised for Biodi(V)strict<sup>®</sup>, a biodiversity simulator used to design positive biodiversity development projects that provide services for users and boost the resilience of cities.</li><li>The second project recognised was the modernisation of the Roland Garros stadium in Paris’s 16<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;<em>arrondissement</em>, for which VINCI Construction France subsidiaries Petit and Chantiers Modernes Construction are carrying out the work in full BIM. The project comprises renovation of the Philippe Chatrier court and construction of a mobile roof, construction of a new semi-underground court surrounded by exotic greenhouses, redevelopment of the Fonds des Princes and creation of green spaces open to the public.</li><li>SICRA Ile-de-France, a subsidiary of VINCI Construction France, was also recognised for the construction of works package 02 of the UNIC residential complex in the Clichy-Batignolles special development zone in Paris 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;arrondissement. The architecture of the mixed-use complex (housing units, some of which are surmounted by a greenhouse and a garden, day-care centre, shops and car park) is inspired by nature and has distinctive curves and bay windows. One special feature of the operation is the design of the terraces and balconies as genuine living spaces.</li></ul>



<p>The Iter and Yamal (VINCI Construction Grands Projets) projects were also recognised as part of this VINCI Construction award, as was Equo Vivo (VINCI Construction Terrassement), for which Urbalia is providing support for the teams in conducting the transformation of a site in Morangis and creating an environmental demonstrator.</p>



<p>1. Geste d’Or is an association that works to foster the built heritage. The association, made up of six colleges, brings together qualified people who are representative of the various sector stakeholders, including architects, engineers, workers, companies of all sizes and elected officials.</p>



<p>2. Urbalia, a biodiversity and urban agriculture consulting firm, was founded by VINCI Construction France and AgroParisTech. It develops and markets Biodi(V)strict®.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A pivotal infrastructure project both for the environment and the country’s sanitation network]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction Grands Projets, in joint venture with its British partner Costain, has just delivered Scotland’s longest wastewater tunnel. At 4.7 metres in diameter and 5 kilometres in length, this major structure, valued at £100 million (€115 million), is part of a programme by Scottish Water, the national water-management authority, designed to enhance water quality, preserve the environment, and prevent flooding in and around Glasgow. On July 30, 2018, Roseanna Cunningham, Scotland’s Cabinet Secretary for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform, officially launched the Shieldhall Tunnel. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>A major environmentally friendly project for Scotland</strong></h4>



<p>This now-completed project delivers major environmental benefits to Greater Glasgow, including a cleaner River Clyde. By providing additional storage capacity of 90,000&nbsp;cubic metres, which is equivalent to 36 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the new tunnel will relieve the current sanitation network and reduce flooding risk in the region. At the official launch of the Shieldhall Tunnel, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham emphasised the structure’s strategic importance: “Communities across Glasgow will benefit for years to come from this latest extraordinary feat of engineering, which lies hidden deep beneath the city.” Completion of the Shieldhall Tunnel is a key achievement in the broader programme designed to modernise Glasgow’s current wastewater-management network. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Leveraging leading-edge expertise to ensure successful project delivery</strong></h4>



<p>A work team nearly 100-strong was mobilised for a period of two years to achieve this major project. A slurry shield tunnel-boring machine (TBM), named Daisy the Driller by a local schoolboy, was used on the project. This 1,000-tonne, 180-metre-long&nbsp;TBM was launched into a cut-and-cover trench 200&nbsp;metres long, 6&nbsp;metres wide large, and 10&nbsp;metres deep. Construction of the trench required excavating more than 25,000&nbsp;tonnes of material in a very constricted working area in close proximity to local residents. The TBM was used in a very busy urban setting beneath active railways and former coal quarries that required treatment prior to the TBM’s passage. &nbsp; In all:</p>



<ul><li>More than 500,000 tonnes of soil, stone, and clay were excavated, and 90% of this material was recycled</li><li>More than 3,200 concrete rings were installed</li><li>5 million work hours were required to complete the project</li></ul>



<h4><strong>VINCI Construction Grands Projets, a leading player in tunnel construction and in the United Kingdom</strong></h4>



<p>In the United Kingdom, VINCI Construction Grands Projets, a subsidiary of VINCI Construction, provides development support to large cities on their sanitation and sewerage schemes thanks to its expertise in large-scale tunnel design and construction. In January 2016, the Company delivered the 7.7-kilometre&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/lee-tunnel/">Lee Tunnel&nbsp;</a>in London. Currently, it is carrying out the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/tideway/">Tideway&nbsp;</a>project in conjunction with partners, including a main 5.5-kilometre tunnel in connection with the Lee Tunnel project.The Shieldhall Tunnel is yet one more achievement in the long list of underground works delivered by VINCI Construction Grands Projets, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/hallandsas-railway-tunnels/">Hallandsås railway tunnels&nbsp;</a>in Sweden, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/tunnels-acces-el-teniente/">El Teniente&nbsp;</a>mine-access tunnels in Chile, and metro-construction projects in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/hong-kong-metro/">Hong Kong</a>, Doha in Qatar, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/cairo-metro/">Cairo in Egypt</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The course of the Nile diverted and later restored to enable dry construction. Irrigation of nearly 700,000 hectares of agricultural land and generation of 32 MW of electrical power.</p>



<p>On August 12, 2018, VINCI Construction Grands Projets delivered the new Assiut Dam, located midway between Cairo and Luxor, in an official ceremony with the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, in attendance. The new dam is located 400 metres downstream from the former dam, an early-20th-century structure that no longer met capacity requirements. The new dam can irrigate nearly 700,000 hectares of additional agricultural land, which is a strategic added value in a country with sustained population growth. The dam will also generate 32 MW of electrical power thanks to four 8-MW turbines and enhance two-way river navigation on the Nile through a system of large locks.</p>



<p>Work on this project, which began in May 2012, consisted initially in drawing down the Nile Valley aquifer to 35 metres below the level of the Nile River on highly permeable alluvial terrain. To that end, we developed a pumping system consisting of 89 deep wells to collect water 40 metres below the riverbed. As a result, to enable dry construction, up to 300,000 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water were evacuated a day. All told, this dam-building project required 370,000 m<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>of concrete (the equivalent of a latest-generation nuclear power plant) and 65,000 tonnes of reinforcement.</p>



<p>This technological performance was made possible thanks to VINCI Construction Grands Projets’ extensive experience in designing and building major dams, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/naga-hammadi-dam/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Naga Hammadi Dam</a>, also located on the Nile in Egypt and delivered in 2008. To achieve the project, 2,200 local workers were hired and trained to meet our standards with regard to safety, quality, and worksite organisation. Currently, VINCI Construction is building another major dam &#8211; in Kenya. In late 2017, the consortium consisting of VINCI Construction Terrassement, Sogea-Satom (subsidiaries of VINCI Construction) and Egis Eau began work on the Ruiru II Dam construction contract whose objective is to increase drinking-water supply in Nairobi.</p>

<p><strong>VINCI Construction, a leading and longstanding player in Egypt</strong></p>



<p>The new Assiut Dam adds to VINCI Construction’s numerous achievements in Egypt, which span more than a century since GTM took part in dredging operations for the Suez Canal as early as 1899. VINCI Construction also contributed to salvage operations for the Nubian temples of Abu Simbel and Amada carried out from 1964 to 1969. Currently, VINCI Construction Grands Projets is taking part in building new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/cairo-metro/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">metro lines in Cairo</a>&nbsp;(Phases 3 and 4a of Line 3), having delivered the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vinci-construction-projets.com/en/realisations/al-azhar-road-tunnels/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">El Azhar road tunnels</a>&nbsp;in 2001 and the Ain Sukhna rolling mill in 2008.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An 80,000 sq. metre mixed-use development near the new Nanterre-La Folie station with high environmental performance standards]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction France has started construction works on the Origine complex in Nanterre on behalf of customer ICADE. The new project is located at the heart of the Quartier des Terrasses, opposite the future Quartier des Groues. The works will be executed by VINCI Construction France with VINCI Energies in charge of the implementation of environmental certificates and labels for the office component and will be completed in autumn 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new contract calls for the construction of three buildings, designed as a window onto the city by Maud Caubet Architectes and Quadrifiore Architecture. Located near the U Arena and new Nanterre-La Folie station (Line E of the RER regional express system and Line 15 of the Grand Paris Express system), the Origine complex contributes to the development of Nanterre&#8217;s Quartier des Terrasses and Quartier des Groues, which are destined to become the links between the city and the La Défense business district.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first two buildings, each with nine storeys and a total surface area of 70,000 sq. metres of office space, will be connected via three underground levels, including two parking levels. On the ground floor, there will be a restaurant shared by all companies, an auditorium, gym and so on. The storeys above the entrance will be cantilevered, supported by a part that is also suspended. This architectural and technical challenge will be made possible by the installation of a metal load-bearing frame weighing 220 tonnes. From the interior garden, it will be possible to see eight storeys of the concrete-wood structure. The office complex will be completed by loggias, making it very light and open to the exterior. The third building, with 10 storeys and a surface area of 10,000 sq. metres, will comprise 145 housing units, a crèche and retail outlets. </p>

<p><strong>An innovative, virtuous project</strong></p>



<p>VINCI Construction France and VINCI Energies teams will execute the entire Origine project in full BIM&nbsp;(Building Information Modelling), which gives the various participants access to all site information in real time.</p>



<p>For the first time in France, Origine aims to achieve a very high environmental performance combining four certifications (HQE 2016 with an Excellent rating, BREEAM with an Excellent rating, LEED with a Gold rating and WELL with a Silver rating), as well as two quality labels (Biodiversity and E+C-), a first in France. The project includes the installation of 2,800 solar panels for lighting and geothermal boreholes for heating. In addition, VINCI Construction France has signed Paris La Défense&#8217;s charter, undertaking to ensure the site causes minimal disturbance to nearby residents.</p>



<p>Lastly, through its Attitude Environment quality label, which covers waste recycling, monitoring and managing water and electricity consumption, CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions, protecting the environment and biodiversity, etc.), VINCI Construction France has committed to minimising the impact of its operations on the environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI subsidiary Sogea-Satom has been awarded two major road building projects in Cameroon for the Public Works Ministry.<br><br>The first contract, valued at €112 million, covers upgrading a 135 km section on the RN15 between Lena and Tibati in the centre of the country and 6.7 km of roads in the town of Tibati. The works consist, notably, of flood-proofing earthworks and construction of a 7m wide carriageway and shoulders, drainage structures and five bridges, together with safety, signage and environmental protection structures. The new corridor is 150 km shorter than the existing road arteries. It will boost trade and connections with Chad and Nigeria.<br><br>The second contract, valued at €102.4 million, concerns construction of a 106 km road section between Olama and Bigambo which will be part of the future Provincial Road 18 (total length 271 km south-west of Yaoundé). The works include construction of five 10 to 20 m-span bridges, 13 km of urban roads and upgrading of 20 km of rural tracks and concrete drainage channels. This artery is primarily intended to take heavy vehicle freight traffic from the new deep-water port of Kribi to Yaoundé. The project also has a social component representing 10% of the value of the contract. It provides for construction of classrooms, rural centres for young people and women, boreholes, wells and playing areas, together with construction of community and health centres along the road.</p>



<p>Delivery of the two projects is scheduled for May 2020 (Lena &#8211; Tibati road) and June 2022 ( Olama-Bigambo road).<br><br>These projects will mobilise substantial human resources on the local level. Sogea-Satom Cameroon organised its first job forum in Douala and Yaoundé in January 2018 to recruit more than 100 new employees. Some 90% of Sogea-Satom employees in Africa are local hires.<br><br>Thanks to its numerous activities, the Cameroon economy is the most diversified in Central Africa. VINCI has completed many projects in the country, notably a water treatment plant in Yaoundé (2014), a runway upgrade for the international airport in Douala (2017) and, more recently, the dual road-rail bridge over the Wouri river in Douala, the first major engineering structure built by VINCI on the African continent.</p>



<ul><li>Upgrading the RN15 over 135 km between Lena and Tibati</li><li>Construction of Provincial Road 18 over 106 km between Olama and Bigambo</li><li>Total value: €214 million</li></ul>

					<description><![CDATA[Joint venture builds 4.4-kilometer underground line and five underground stations. The design and build contract value amounts €460 million]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI and HOCHTIEF, in a joint venture, have been awarded the design and build contract for Sydhavn Metro Line (Line 4) in Copenhagen. The client Metroselskabet has awarded the contract to an equal-parts joint venture consisting of VINCI Construction Grands Projets and HOCHTIEF Infrastructure. HOCHTIEF will be the technical leader of the joint venture. The €460 million contract was signed on February 28, 2018 in Copenhagen.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="531" height="599" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copenhagen_entier_en.jpg" alt="copenhagen metro" class="wp-image-3216" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copenhagen_entier_en.jpg 531w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/copenhagen_entier_en-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;Eighteen years after the delivery of the Øresund tunnel and two years after the award of the Femern tunnel, it&#8217;s our honor to continue to work for the Danish people&#8217;s daily mobility with a new line of underground metro, especially with our historical partner HOCHTIEF&#8221;, says Eric Chambraud, Operations Director Northern Europe, British Isles and Americas at VINCI Construction Grands Projets.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are very pleased to have this opportunity of demonstrating our tunneling expertise in Copenhagen again. This contract continues our successful activities in the Danish infrastructure market. We are looking forward to working once again together with VINCI&#8221;, says Riku Tauriainen, Executive Vice President of HOCHTIEF Infrastructure GmbH Europe West.</p>



<p>This design and build project for the southern metro line is a six-year mandate that calls for the construction of dual 4.4-kilometer tunnels using two earth-pressure tunnel boring machines (TBM) along with five underground stations and two crossover structures. The project also includes electrical and mechanical systems, architectural interior works, and in-tunnel ventilation.</p>



<p>The tunnels will have an interior diameter of 4.9 meters and an exterior diameter of 5.5 meters. This metro-network extension south of the Danish capital (Sydhavn or M4) will be connected to the main ring line (Cityringen).</p>



<p>VINCI and HOCHTIEF have brought together their skill sets in design, project management, and underground works to build this new metro line. For the first time in Denmark, 3D modeling will be used extensively as early as the bid-submission phase by the consortium. VINCI and HOCHTIEF have a longstanding tradition of collaboration, including on metro projects (such as the one in Athens, for example). More recently, the two groups have joined forces on projects in Greece and in other countries outside Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since May 2016, the VINCI Group has led the joint venture entrusted with the task of building the world&#8217;s longest underwater tunnel: the Femernbelt, which is 18 kilometers long and will link Denmark and Germany. In 1996, VINCI delivered the Storebælt railway tunnels connecting Copenhagen to the mainland. In 2000, VINCI delivered the Øresund tunnel connecting Denmark and Sweden. VINCI Construction Grands Projets is a world-leading design-build specialist in urban mobility with current metro projects for Hong Kong, Cairo in Egypt, Doha and Lusail in Qatar, and, more recently, Lot&nbsp;GC02&nbsp;for Line 14 South and Lot T3C for Line 15 of Grand Paris Express.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Copenhagen HOCHTIEF, in a joint venture, is currently executing the Metro Cityringen Branch-off to Nordhavn tunnel project. In the capital of Denmark, the company also built an approximately four-kilometer-long district heating tunnel. HOCHTIEF has already been successfully operating on the Scandinavian infrastructure market for many years. For instance, the company was responsible for building the Eastern Bridge over the Great Belt. Another milestone is the construction of the Øresund Bridge between Copenhagen and Malmö, in which HOCHTIEF also had a significant participation.</p>

<p>VINCI Construction, through a joint venture led by Dodin Campenon Bernard and including GTM Ouest and Botte Fondations, both subsidiaries of VINCI Construction France, along with Spie Batignolles TPCI, Spie Fondations and Legendre Génie Civil, has successfully completed tunnelling Line b, the second automated metro line in Rennes, for regional authority Rennes Métropole and transport authority Semtcar. Line b will run between the south-west and north-east of the urban area and will serve 15 stations by 2020.</p>



<p>After 38 months of operation, tunnel boring machine Elaine, specially designed for this project, arrived at its exit shaft. At the end of this phase, Elaine will have travelled about 8.5 km deep underground, passing nine stations and four ventilation shafts. In total, the tunnel boring machine (TBM), which measures 82 metres long and has a diameter of 9 metres, installed 29,806 arch liners.</p>



<p>The joint venture exploited every possible synergy between its participating companies to find innovative technical solutions to the numerous geological challenges encountered along the route. The civil engineering project is scheduled for completion during the summer of 2018. Line b of the Rennes metro is designed to support the urban area’s growth. The Rennes network (STAR) recorded 76.8 million trips in 2014. With the creation of Line b, traffic is forecast to reach 120 million trips in 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>VINCI Construction subsidiary HEB Construction, has been chosen as part of an alliance contract<sup>1</sup> to build the Northern Corridor Improvements Project (NCI Project). With a total value of $700 million New- Zealand dollars (around €415 million), the contract aims at creating a new connection north of Auckland between the Northern Motorway (State Highway 1) and Upper Harbour Highway (State Highway 18), as well as extending the Northern Busway to Albany and add more than 7 kilometres of new walking and cycling paths.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="671" height="592" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heb_infographie_en.jpg" alt="heb infographie" class="wp-image-3279" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heb_infographie_en.jpg 671w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/heb_infographie_en-300x265.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /></figure>



<p>The NCI Project Alliance comprises the New Zealand Transport Agency, HEB Construction, Fulton Hogan, Opus and Jacobs.</p>



<p>The project is an important link in helping to realize the full benefits of the Western Ring Route by giving users an alternative route to State Highway 1 and the Auckland Harbour Bridge. It will also create better travel choices for walkers, cyclists and users of public transport.</p>



<p>The Alliance is now tasked with finalising the detailed design and beginning construction early this year. The project will be undertaken in stages over the next four years. The first steps towards construction will include road resurfacing and the installation of moveable median barriers.</p>



<p>The Alliance has started recruiting for more than 150 new roles including surveyors, engineers, safety advisors, machine operators, drainlayers, carpenters and general construction field staff.</p>



<p>Since VINCI finalized the acquisition of HEB Construction in June 2015, the company worked in New- Zealand as a member of The North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery Alliance (NCTIR) on&nbsp;reconstruction following the earthquake that&nbsp; struck the Kaikoura region in November 2016.</p>



<p>HEB Construction is also working on the Nga Puna Wai sports centre and on several marine works projects: Centreport container quay repair, Port Otago quay extension and Port of Lyttelton terminal construction.</p>



<h6><sup>1</sup> Alliance contracts are incentive-based relationship contracts in which the parties agree to work together as one integrated team. In an alliance contract, the owner, contractor and designer are all parties to one project agreement.</h6>

					<description><![CDATA[Consortium led by VINCI Construction, together with Spie batignolles, wins a new contract on the metro Line 14 South as part of the future Grand Paris Express rapid transit system]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The consortium led by VINCI Construction (Dodin Campenon Bernard, lead company; VINCI Construction France; VINCI Construction Grands Projets and Botte Fondations), together with Spie batignolles (Spie batignolles Génie Civil and Spie batignolles Fondations), has been awarded a major contract as part of the Grand Paris Express programme. The RATP<sup>1</sup> has selected this consortium to execute works package GC02 of the future Line 14 South between Olympiades (in the 13<sup>th</sup> arrondissement of Paris) and Orly Airport.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="593" height="533" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ligne_14_infographie_en.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-3244" srcset="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ligne_14_infographie_en.jpg 593w, https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ligne_14_infographie_en-300x270.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" /></figure>



<p>The contract, worth almost €400 million (excluding tax), requires the use of an earth pressure balance tunnel boring machine to excavate a 4.6 km tunnel between Maison Blanche Paris XIII futur station and the TBM starting shaft at Jean Prouvé. It also includes construction of the new Kremlin Bicêtre Hôpital station and five ventilation and emergency shafts. The contract is scheduled to last 72 months.</p>



<h4>A large-scale project in an urban environment</h4>



<p></p>



<p>The GC02 works package site cuts through Paris, Kremlin Bicêtre, Gentilly, Villejuif and L’Haÿ-les-Roses. It also passes near Kremlin Bicêtre Hospital and the A6 motorway. Integrating the worksite into this environment is a major challenge that has led to numerous consultation meetings being held between the RATP, the Société du Grand Paris (SGP) and all the cities, local authorities and residents involved.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Innovative and ambitious social integration programme</h4>



<p></p>



<p>This package’s works will create almost 250 jobs. Significant measures are planned for the integration of around 50 long-term unemployed people, with some 83,000 hours of training and support to be provided over the course of the project. In 2011, VINCI set up ViE (VINCI insertion Emploi), an entity specialising in social and professional integration, to help Group companies with this aspect of their contracts.</p>



<p>In addition, the “Chantiers et Territoires Solidaires” endowment fund created by VINCI will support public interest projects implemented in the vicinity of the worksites.</p>



<p>Spie batignolles is also strongly committed to facilitating the social and professional integration of marginalised people, notably through its Fondation Spie batignolles.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Line 14 South, the link with Orly Airport</h4>



<p></p>



<p>A missing link between central Paris and Orly Airport, the Line 14 South will be used by more than 260,000 residents of Paris and the Val de Marne and Essonne départements. It will provide connections with metro Line 7, Line C of the Paris RER regional express system, Line 7 of the tram system and Lines 15 South and 18 of the Grand Paris Express rapid transit system. It will create a fast link between Paris and Orly Airport, which is essential for 2024 when the city will host the Olympic Games.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VINCI Construction and Spie batignolles, two players already working on major metro projects&nbsp;</strong>VINCI Construction and Spie batignolles are participating in the extension of Lines 4, 12, and 14 of the Paris metro, which is managed by the RATP.</p>



<p>In addition, VINCI Construction and Spie batignolles, in a consortium, have won works packages T3C (€926 million) and T2D (€156 million) for Line 15 South of the Grand Paris Express programme, which is managed by the SGP.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Consortium:</h4>



<ul><li>VINCI Construction:</li><li>Dodin Campenon Bernard (consortium leader)</li><li>VINCI Construction Grands Projets</li><li>VINCI Construction France</li><li>Botte Fondations Spie batignolles:</li><li>Spie batignolles génie civil</li><li>Spie batignolles fondations </li></ul>



<p><strong>Programme management:</strong>&nbsp;RATP</p>



<p><strong>Project management: ELIOS&nbsp;</strong>consortium comprising Setec TPI (leader), Systra, Groupe 6, Jean Paul Viguier et Associés, Franklin Azzi Architecture, Brunet Saunier Architecture and Valode &amp; Pistre</p>



<h6><sup>1</sup> Programme management of the extension of Line 14 to the south has been temporarily transferred to the RATP (excluding the Villejuif Institut G. Roussy and Orly Airport stations, for which the programme managers are Société du Grand Paris and Paris Aéroport respectively).</h6>

					<description><![CDATA[The Polish capital, in full economic swing, calls more and more often on Warbud, a subsidiary of VINCI Construction International Network.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the site of the former Mint of Poland in the centre of Warsaw, Warbud, a subsidiary of VINCI Construction International Network, is currently building the Mennica Legacy Tower, an upscale office complex that will rise to a height of 140 metres. The complex will meet the highest international aesthetic, ergonomic and materials standards. It is designed to achieve international BREEAM Excellent environmental certification. The project, in which Warbud is responsible for all construction works packages, is scheduled for completion in 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="252" height="174" src="https://www.vinci-construction.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bureaux_tour-skylinervarsovie-pologne_article_list.jpg" alt="skyliner varsovie" class="wp-image-3331"/></figure>



<p>In the center of Warsaw, Warbud is building the Skyline tower, on of the capital’s tallest and most modern office buildings. The 195-metre tower will have 45 levels, including 30 devoted to office space, four to shops and five to underground car parks. Like the Mennica Legacy Tower, the building aims for BREEAM Excellent certification. Work is scheduled for completion in mid-2020.</p>



<p>Also notworthy is the start of work on the foundations of the Generation Park buildings, a mixes-use complex in the centre of Warsaw built by Soletanche Polska.</p>



<p>Lastly, in January 2018 Warbud won the contract to build the 310-metre (including a 80-metre mast) Varso Tower, also in the centre of Warsaw.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Following its delivery of the extension to the Niroth plant in Phnom Penh in early 2017, this summer VINCI Construction Grands Projets signed a further contract for the Cambodian capital with PPWSA, the Phnom Penh water authority.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h5>Following its delivery of the extension to the Niroth plant in Phnom Penh in early 2017, this summer VINCI Construction Grands Projets signed a further contract for the Cambodian capital with PPWSA, the Phnom Penh water authority.</h5>



<p>This concerns the renovation of the Chamkar Mon water treatment plant, valued at some €21 million. Teams have been working since September on the demolition of the existing plant, prior to the design-build phase for the new plant which will see the production of drinking water there increase from 20,000 to 52,000 cu. metres a day. The works will take two years.</p>



<p>A second contract, worth about €8.8 million, was also signed this summer, with SRWSA, the water authority in Siem Reap, for the city’s water treatment plant. It covers the design-build of a water intake structure (30,000 cu. metres/day), increasing the existing plant’s drinking-water production capacity by 15,000 cu. metres/day and the laying of a 6.5 km-long connecting pipe. In total, 14 months of works and a four-month commissioning period have been scheduled.&#8221;</p>



<p>In Vietnam, meanwhile, August 2017 saw VINCI Construction Grands Projets secure, together with Bessac (Soletanche Freyssinet), the design-build contract for the construction of a 10 km-long pipe to supply treated water to the centre of Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s economic capital.</p>



<p>Valued at some €60 million, it covers the detailed design of the project, the manufacture of the prefabricated pipe elements in reinforced concrete (external diameter: 3 m) and their installation using the pipe jacking technique, and the creation of 16 shafts, 11 connections and 5 branch sockets for future connections to the network. Lasting three-and-a-half years, this project will rely on the combined expertise of VINCI Construction Grands Projets in the management of hydraulic projects and Bessac in the field of micro-tunnelling.</p>



<p>Over the last five years, the structures created worldwide by VINCI Construction Grands Projets have made possible the production of a million cu. metres of drinking water a day.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[One of the biggest ground reinforcement operations ever carried out by Soletanche Bachy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As part of the extension of Hong Kong International Airport, Soletanche Bachy, a subsidiary of VINCI specialising in foundations and soil technologies, has entered a 50-50 joint-venture with its South Korean partner Sambo E&amp;C. Together, they are carrying out soil reinforcement using the Geomix® technique (or Cutter Soil Mixing &#8211; CSM) in height-restricted conditions near the airport’s existing north runway. The contract, signed at the end of September 2016 and worth €380 million (HKD3.31 billion), also includes the construction of a temporary 1,500 square metres metal platform on piles around the approach beacons to the north runway, which will remain in service throughout.<br>By 2030, the number of passengers forecast to use Hong Kong International Airport will reach 102 million per year, compared to 68 million in 2015. To cope with this increase in traffic and provide airlines with capacity to introduce new destinations and more flights, Hong Kong International Airport is building a third runway on 650 hectares extending over the sea.</p>



<p>Work started at the end of 2016 with the initial measurement and test phases, and maritime operations, and will be completed within two-and-a-half years.<br>Work carried out from barges, in restricted height areas, and on a site in use<br>The safety and Airport Height Restriction (AHR) constraints imposed forbid the use of equipment taller than five meters, making this site very complex. The work has to be carried out without ever interrupting the airport’s activity. All of the work will be done from the sea using barges equipped with sophisticated monitoring systems, notably to anticipate the impact on construction from risks such as infringement of AHR, waves and typhoons.</p>



<p>A vast Geomix® operation</p>



<p>Geomix® is a patented Soletanche Bachy process which enables the characteristics of the soil in place to be improved using a soil-cement mix. It offers a more economic and safer solution, that has lower environmental impact, notably due to the reduction in natural resources used and spoil produced. Up to eighteen Geomix® soil-cement mixing plants will be installed on site, allowing for low headroom deep cement mixing. It is the biggest Geomix® soil reinforcing operation ever undertaken by Soletanche Bachy.</p>



<p>Solutions that meet strict environmental requirements</p>



<p>To meet the environmental demands of the contracting authority, Hong Kong International Airport, and the prime contractors, Atkins and Mott MacDonald, numerous protection measures have been put in place to limit the risk of pollution. These include permanent monitoring of water quality, triple anti-pollution floating barriers, the establishment of a safety perimeter, and environmental training to monitor and safeguard marine life in the estuary, in particular the Chinese white dolphin, a protected species also known as the pink dolphin.</p>
